2020-09-16 20:55:02: PS5 has won, but the price is ridiculous. People can't afford that right now and will go with Xbox S at $299.

2020-09-16 20:55:27: Xbox is not bad, Playstation is just better :)
2020-09-16 20:55:27: Rip xbox
2020-09-16 20:55:28: This entire Showcase was just a W for Sony
2020-09-16 20:58:44: > Then why I am so fundamentally disappointing?
2020-09-16 21:03:58: > I mean, the games they showed look great, but almost none of them are new announcements... doesnt change the fact that Ps5 has way more games that look way better than what Xbox has.
2020-09-16 21:04:43: > 2 words, Xbox Gamepass
2020-09-16 21:05:02: > @MORKS isn't here right now People dont care about the new game because they just say Skip in chat, they wanted the release date and price and thats what they got
2020-09-16 21:05:29: > @Reno Thomas because at this point you're becoming ungrateful and wanting more
2020-09-16 21:05:31: > @PanCAKEboi here you go ps plus will have most ps4 exclusives
2020-09-16 21:05:57: > @MORKS isn't here right now there's some new announcements tho
2020-09-16 21:06:10: > MORKS isn't here right now Xbox Graphics are better then the ps5 for Multiplayer but the ps5 has graphics then the Xbox for single-player games
2020-09-16 21:06:10: > @MORKS isn't here right now Playstation exclusives are more or less for OGs,Most xbox exclusives are new games, Cant really compare the two. But your wallet has my blessings if your getting the ps5
2020-09-16 21:07:48: > PanCAKEboi two letters, PC
2020-09-16 21:07:51: > @PanCAKEboi 1 word PC
2020-09-16 21:09:03: > @PanCAKEboi pc
2020-09-16 21:09:39: > @FUN FACT PsPlus is literally G a r b a g e. Im not doing console wars rn but you have to agree tbh, Gamepass is affordable and for what you get its definitely worth the what like 15 dollars for ultimate which Includes live? Microsoft has affordable things while sony not so much
2020-09-16 21:11:30: > @Sonic the hedgehog i mean either way the money goes to microsoft depending what pc so yeah... Xbox/Microsoft....
2020-09-16 21:12:29: > @PanCAKEboi sure but this means that Xbox is useless
2020-09-16 21:12:53: > Reno Thomas same
2020-09-16 21:13:55: > @Sonic the hedgehog not really not everyone has 1,000 plus dollars for a decent gaming PC
2020-09-16 21:14:19: > @PanCAKEboi You have to admit the games youre getting for Gamepass are alright at best. Im saying that as someone who pays for Gamepass right now. Its nothing to hang your hat on. Its cool for younger people who cant afford games, sure. But anybody could buy a PC and play Xbox titles on release. 500 for this console isnt gonna break anyones bank lol People who want a new console have saved for it...
2020-09-16 21:15:38: > @just did 10 years Isn't game pass is also on the phones now?
2020-09-16 21:15:52: > MORKS isn't here right now a large amount of those games were for both consoles, not all were PS5 exclusives
2020-09-16 21:16:27: > How? No one is going to buy the digital version for a $100 bucks less l.
2020-09-16 21:17:16: > @timil_ deeps I wouldn't say that
2020-09-16 21:18:19: > Reno Thomas  Because you dont know true talent when you see it :)
2020-09-16 21:18:29: > @Sonic the hedgehog not if your paying them.
2020-09-16 21:19:27: > @timil_ deeps then Xbox is useless. My point still stands.
2020-09-16 21:19:52: > @Sonic the hedgehog Sony failed to match Xbox at $299 price point.
2020-09-16 21:20:59: > @Sonic the hedgehog well if your paying Xbox apparently their not useless lol.
2020-09-16 21:21:18: > PanCAKEboi yeah, thats what Im really worried about...
2020-09-16 21:21:21: > @timil_ deeps Parents will to save a buck. Just being honest. Im getting the disc version obviously.
2020-09-16 21:23:24: > right parents will save a buck, Xbox 299, and PlayStation 399 just saying lol.
2020-09-16 21:23:48: > @timil_ deeps you obviously don't understand. I'm taking about the console
2020-09-16 21:24:06: > @timil_ deeps you act like Xbox is going to win lol
2020-09-16 21:25:58: > @Sonic the hedgehog im preety sure it is prolly xbox seems to be transtoning more into a brand rather then a simply just a gaming console
2020-09-16 21:27:29: > @just did 10 years Yeah that's why I think
2020-09-16 21:28:08: > @just did 10 years Well Xbox has been a brand but more of a streaming service like stadia
2020-09-16 21:28:28: > @timil_ deeps You know there are parents who only go for PS or Xbox just like a fanboy does lol That applies as well. Js
2020-09-16 21:28:39: > @Sonic the hedgehog your still on the console wars lol. Open your eyes to what Microsoft has done. Project x cloud, gamepass, and backwards compatibility. They don't care what you play on as long as your paying them.
2020-09-16 21:30:06: > @Sonic the hedgehog with all the services, yes Xbox will win this war lol. Your talking about a 40 billion dollar company going up against a trillion dollar company. You do the math lol.
2020-09-16 21:34:13: > @Karn Liberated say what you will, the virus hit alot of parents hard, and the Xbox is going to look even more appealing at 299.
2020-09-16 21:35:10: > @timil_ deeps I agree with that. Im only saying you'll be surprised at how many will still buy the PS5 disc-less version.
2020-09-16 21:39:58: > PanCAKEboi Two words PSN Now you idiot your not that special we have it but better
2020-09-17 02:30:48: > @Tasty Toast Also PSN is 3 letters
2020-09-17 02:34:29: > @Tasty Toast The console, the games, the PSN, etc.
2020-09-16 20:55:34: When is pre orders up

2020-09-16 20:57:45: > thats probably how much the disc drive is.
2020-09-16 20:58:25: > Not really they will earn more money as you can only buy games from them and with disc version you can find cheap games so I suggest investing 100 dollars
2020-09-16 20:55:46: LET ME GET THAT DIGITAL VERSION FOR $399 !

2020-09-16 23:24:58: > @Warlord Is Here Im here for smoke not perfectly neat paragraphs lol
2020-09-16 23:26:56: > @Random FaceOnTheIntenet No it didnt your prolly looking at your little false playstation fanboy articles. They nearly tied but just watch Xbox will catch up to Sonys PS4 sales now that every mother and toddler knows about gaming now, and if they dont theyll come close youll see.
2020-09-19 19:25:17: > @Twisted Parasite No they didnt their literally tied almost. Lol who cares about sales anyways. How many of those ps3s broke and collected dust on peoples shelves. No one talked about it back then other than to say it was garbage and overpriced. Xbox had double almost triple the amount of players online per day at the time. Their making their comeback from the OneX this gen too just watch.
2020-09-22 04:39:42: > @LordReef k
2020-09-23 21:36:31: > @LordReef please cheef stand down i think you are just broke im just asking for the price lol
2020-09-23 21:36:43: > @Shakil Mia thanks
2020-09-16 20:56:58: Thank you Sony,  you just made my decision on whether to buy an Nvidia 3080 series much easier.....
2020-09-16 21:06:33: > Of course a pc will always be better than a console you idiot. You just gotta pay waaaay more and expect every multiplayer game to be ruined by hackers.
2020-09-16 21:13:51: > Still got no exclusives. It's not the specs. It's the games.
2020-09-16 20:56:59: Best Thing That Came Out of This Was BOCW...
2020-09-16 20:58:56: > I enjoyed the Chat

2020-09-16 20:57:09: Why Uk have to wait an extra week
2020-09-16 21:02:01: > I like how they launch it South Korea on the 12th but not the UK as well, ok. Bit of a strange thing there.
2020-09-16 20:57:09: Price in KSA
2020-09-16 20:57:10: I was really looking forward to a trailer for my favorite game: Graphical User Interface (GUI).

2020-09-16 20:59:27: > No theyll only lose if GTA6 Comes out
2020-09-16 21:00:12: > How tho. We barely saw any new announcements.
2020-09-16 21:04:12: > DRAW LIKE MATT and those games are still better than the big Xbox games
2020-09-16 20:57:19: This showcase was an huge L again.. I am a Playstation fan since the Playstation one, I'll give Xbox the win on this one.
2020-09-16 21:05:40: > What does the Xbox have again?
2020-09-16 20:57:19: 59:18 is when it starts, idk why theyd make us wait an hour after its posted lol
2020-09-16 20:59:43: > Because thats how stream replays work  Itll get cut by the end of the week
2020-09-16 21:00:09: > 7PortugalCR7 they started a "waiting lobby" type thing an hour before the stream and they didn't post the video, after the live stream ended it automatically posted the whole stream.

2020-09-16 20:57:27: Five Nights At Freddys: Security Breach  Me: *In 3 months people spend money*
2020-09-16 21:00:46: > I didn't expect five nights at Freddy's coming to Playstation at all to be honest
2020-09-16 20:57:29: *On this episode of catfish, a Nintendo who thought it was dating a PlayStation, turned out to be an Xbox*
2020-09-16 20:57:30: Fnaf pops out of nowhere - yeah Fortnite is on ps5 - obvious so meh Ps plus remaster- they coulda done that before but they didnt bruh Resident evil - meh 2 is way better my gut tells me COD - I so far love this Hitman - didnt even have a trailer but was like a ad 5% of the time  Harry Potter tho - ill play when i watch the films one day
2020-09-16 21:00:29: > what is ps plus remaster? i missed that part sorry
2020-09-16 21:01:49: > @julianamir 1:39:10
2020-09-16 20:57:30: My disappointment is immeasurable for the lack of Silent Hill. 100% done with believing leakers.
2020-09-16 21:04:41: > Agree!!! What a disappointment.

2020-09-16 20:57:43: No black version. No matter. £449.99 is fair enough.
2020-09-16 20:57:44: Showcase starts at 59:18
2020-09-16 20:57:46: best presentation ever! sony for the win 
2020-09-16 20:57:50: Showing RE8, Deathloop and Oddworld trailers AGAIN was a complete waste of space.
2020-09-16 20:57:52: That was kinda trash to be honest
2020-09-16 20:57:55: BUT I will still buy the console cuzz its LITTT

2020-09-16 20:58:00: PS4 nostalgia is already kicking in
2020-09-16 20:58:01: nice middleground option between series S and X i suppose. step down from teh series X in terms of performance and step up from the series S.   valuewise its kinda hard to beat the subscription approach from M$
2020-09-16 21:03:29: > Quality over quantity
2020-09-16 21:04:23: > Series "S" will look great for 1080p gaming or upscale for 4K.  PS5 is aiming for 4K, but not as powerful as Series "X."  New Switch 4K version releasing next year.
2020-09-16 21:12:09: > @Shock Value you said everything..
2020-09-17 08:47:35: > @FL33T WOOD will be interesting to see the ARM+Nvidia solution that they will use for the next Nintendo console.   and for the sake of the xbox, i hope it adds propper keyboard and mouse support, add youtube and a browser and its better than most PCs. same applies to PS5
2020-09-16 20:58:01: Skipping all my November bills!!! And no one is getting Xmas present from me!!!

2020-09-16 21:05:07: > I think its so that Xbox players who are changing to PlayStation can enjoy the previous generation of exclusives, which is pretty sick.

2020-09-16 21:01:36: > Lepjar PS4 oh bruh
2020-09-16 20:58:47: No PS5 launch titles at all? Not even Demon's Souls? Get an RTX 3070 and play Cyberpunk 2077 on it with keyboard and mouse and mods.   Xbox wins. It only wins because it's the same price but more powerful. They also have no games at launch. Halo delayed. What a shame! 
2020-09-16 20:58:47: I'm soooo hype to buy one now

2020-09-16 21:10:37: > Thank you sooooooo much
2020-09-16 21:10:48: > @LordReef stay on xbox with your screeching cod fanboys, faulty hardware, and lack of interesting games. After the 360 the whole xbox franchise redringed.
2020-09-16 21:11:43: > Cool thanks.
2020-09-16 21:11:43: > Youre a hero 
2020-09-16 21:12:38: > @Porygon Z Nope I refuse to see more of my childhood games get ruined. Were bringing cod back. Your all trash teammates, and wouldnt know what makes a great compelling game

2020-09-16 21:13:08: > The hero we need
2020-09-16 21:13:38: > Your our savior!
2020-09-16 21:13:59: > i hope the Canadian price is fair like Xbox Series X because if they did the conversion the prices for PS5 would be $525/$660
2020-09-16 21:13:59: > i love you broo
2020-09-16 21:14:03: > I LOVE U SM

2020-09-16 21:17:02: > As someone who loves to save money, I'll be getting the physical version. Re-Sell games, trade games, trade games in, borrow games, rent games. Also, physical games become much much cheaper than digital games. I'll make back that extra $100 within a week after buying the console lol.
2020-09-16 21:17:09: > I remember when the GameCube flopped because it released a couple days after the Xbox.
2020-09-16 21:17:55: > The fact that it releases on my birthday is kinda cool

2020-09-16 21:19:57: > Ps5 DE-$400 full next gen experience or XBox Series S-$300 watered down next gen experience. I wanna see the sales report on launch weekend on those
2020-09-16 21:20:34: > @LordReef bring cod back? Xbox has nothing to do with the creation of cod. And I've seen more toxic people and fortnite kids on xbox.
2020-09-16 21:21:17: > @Cringe Boi 659 plus tax
2020-09-16 21:22:18: > Thanks bro

2020-09-16 21:24:53: > @Disknee not at all. Mine is silent because I have a clean house and take care of my things. Even if that wasn't the case I would rather have a loud console that works than an Xbox that is riddled with bugs and malfunctions.
2020-09-16 21:25:33: > Ty bro
2020-09-16 21:26:25: > @LordReef stfu cod fanboy I'm tired of hearing people like you  games are all fun anyways

2020-09-16 22:16:16: > why not just post the price and date here .. but thanks though
2020-09-16 22:21:47: > @LordReef get outta here with that 360 era. That was like what 15 years ago.  You need to get over that.  XBox has the game pass I'll give them that but other than that whats the motivation for getting a series x?  Unless you're in the Xbox cult religiously  ps5 is the way to go.
2020-09-16 22:28:02: > @Said Zaragoza Motivation is cheap powerful console you can take anywhere
2020-09-16 23:19:57: > @Said Zaragoza Nope me and a handful of people will never get over it. The motivation is the community and its about which community helps gaming and are more skilled teammates. In which that case Xbox is the best online multiplayer console. If you fail to see that gaming has become trash then your no different from the rest mate.
2020-09-16 23:54:35: > @LordReef what are talking about? There are skilled people on PC, XBox and PlayStation what does that have to do with anything.  PlayingStation is gonna have some great titles at launch and Xbox won't.   Beside if you and your "mates" all get the PlayStation 5 that won't even matter
2020-09-17 02:54:58: > @Said Zaragoza Skilled people on ps4? Yeah right man. Every team Im stuck with is trash. I guess you wouldnt realize cause you havent won any competitive tournament ladders. Ive witnessed both communitys for 7 years each and witnessed the birth of online gaming and without doubt PS players are the most dogsht players ive played with.
2020-09-22 17:45:50: > *$70 games....*

2020-09-16 21:01:48: > It will be
2020-09-16 21:03:35: > It already is.  W for PS5. F for Xbox. (Xbox aint bad. In my opinion, its just 10000000 times worse than PlayStation.)
2020-09-16 21:00:12: You're all dumbss ps4 new gens who never witnessed the 360 era. Xbox is bringing this industry and cod back from what you guys ruined. Stay on ps5 with your MOVIES that arent video games, and fortnite where you belong.
2020-09-16 21:01:39: > ...mad?
2020-09-16 21:01:58: > @Black Panther Nah just laughing.

2020-09-16 21:55:45: > LordReef Bruh, you mad asf, and notice how you liked your own comment. Xbox is meh, nd most of who are gonna buy the ps5 have played atleast in the PS3 era, and about trash teammates your just bad yourself.

2020-09-16 21:00:18: Rip Xbox PS5 wins
2020-09-16 21:00:18: That's a reasonable price.
2020-09-16 21:18:08: > Digital is basically the same price as a PS4 Pro but you just can't use physical disks but it seems like a reasonable sacrifice
2020-09-16 21:00:19: Was here during the stream

2020-09-16 21:00:33: Ima have to say it PS5 or Xbox
2020-09-16 21:00:34: 100$ extra just to put a dvd on a console What the actually f***
2020-09-16 21:03:00: > It probably has loads more functions than just playing discs
2020-09-16 21:04:05: > Game disc, movies and idk about music cds
2020-09-16 21:05:09: > @*The Channel of Cringe* But i think you'll be able to play discs on 4K quality, probably why it aint that cheap

2020-09-16 21:19:27: > TOMORROW at selected retailers
2020-09-16 21:00:43: The price on digital tho
2020-09-16 21:00:43: PS5=W XBOX=L
2020-09-16 21:00:44: Miles Morales needs to hit the gym.
2020-09-16 21:40:27: > He gets those gains from super hero work
2020-09-16 21:00:47: When is pre order
2020-09-16 21:00:47: Price?
2020-09-16 21:00:47: $399 for the digital is this a joke.
2020-09-16 21:02:21: > Its not like its a low end model like the S  Its the same specs except for no disc drive
2020-09-16 21:03:57: > Unlike the Xbox, that's 399 for the exact same PS5 as the 499 version. The only difference is one has a disc drive and one doesn't.
2020-09-16 21:05:08: > The Xbox S will sell more than the ps5 digital version for sure.
2020-09-16 21:09:56: > its the same price as the ps4 pro lololol
2020-09-16 21:12:48: > @Cody Sinclair why buy the digital one for only $100 cheaper. people will buy the disc version of the ps5. Xbox series S $299, and Xbox series x $499 a $200 differnce. Sony done lost with their digital console.
2020-09-16 21:18:12: > @timil_ deeps I mean, I can't speak for everyone else but I rarely buy physical games anymore. So a 399 digital PS5 is very attractive to me.
2020-09-16 21:25:51: > @Cody Sinclair right, im not saying it isn't attractive to everyone. I just wish PlayStation would have matched Xbox at $299.
2020-09-16 21:32:25: > @timil_ deeps I think that might have been wishful thinking though. Again, keep in mind that the Xbox S is only 200 cheaper because it has different specs than the full 599 Series X. If I remember correctly, the Series S can only output 1440p at 60fps while the Series X is said to be 8k ready. There is no such spec difference with the PS5 -- just one has a 4k disc drive and one doesn't. In other words, you potentially could get the full PS5 experience for the same price as a PS4. That's a pretty great deal in its own right in my opinion.
2020-09-16 21:37:43: > @Cody Sinclair right, im not disagreeing with you, but since the virus hit everyone hard. I I thing Sony should have aimed as close as possible to 299 price point.
2020-09-16 21:40:37: > @timil_ deeps Fair enough. I've been saving up for the PS5 since the reveal event and even I've had to dip into that PS5 reserve a few times now. Either way, Xbox or Playstation, I just can't wait for all the fun times ahead :D
2020-09-16 21:45:48: > @Cody Sinclair same bro, I owned them all this generation. I'm just looking for the salty ponies out here, the one's where PlayStation is better than PC, and believe PlayStation is the second coming of Christ lol.
2020-09-16 21:00:48: Who here after ps6?

2020-09-16 21:01:02: The ps5 price is:  £499.99, $499.99, 499.99, ¥49,980     Digital version is: £359.99 $399.99 399.99, ¥39,980

2020-09-16 21:17:02: > @longBeach_ Lakers hmm the 100 difference is relative for everyone, to some it won't seem much but to others it might

2020-09-16 21:15:07: > The only thing on that list that really matters:  Better Games.  I'd rather play an amazing PS2 game on the PS2 over an average game on Xbox Series S.
2020-09-16 21:15:56: > For the same price of a PS5 you get better everything
2020-09-16 21:18:20: > RAM isn't doubled

2020-09-16 21:08:35: > FL33T WOOD That is only from the PlayStation website, you can preorder normally from anywhere else bro.

2020-09-16 21:07:16: Is the console more expensive in Canada or it's still 500$?
2020-09-16 21:07:17: Well well well... I see everybody is acting like they're so hyped about the games. But didn't you guys complained and acted all toxic during the direct?. Why the sudden change, eh?. Do ya think you can fool me?
2020-09-16 21:07:18: See you guys in 6 yrs
2020-09-16 21:07:19: I'd rather buy the xbox series x for $ 500 than the less powerful ps5 that probably sounds like an airplane turbine and gets hotter than my ex-girlfriend
2020-09-16 21:07:22: Why no gt7? :/
2020-09-16 21:07:24: I was only here for FNAF...
2020-09-16 21:07:26: So Europe must pay the most and must wait a week longer.
2020-09-16 21:12:36: > Canada as well !
2020-09-16 21:16:42: > It all costs the same
2020-09-16 21:18:12: > everybody pays the same amount, different currencies are worth more
2020-09-16 21:19:13: > @JakeSnake2398 _ it doesnt,in brazil for example a ps4 can cost like 3 times more if you put reals back into dolars

My neighberhood are full of BMW M cars M3 M4 M5 M6 M8 even Lamborghini Aventador SV, Ferrari, Bentley, Porsches, AMGs and then I look to myself nothing but only a rusty bicycle. Im a real car lover but didnt drive in 11 years a car let alone a M car. Im trying to fullfill my dream in simracing playing games like Gran Turismo Sport and Assetto Corsa Competizione thats the closest I can get to simulate a real car. Offcourse the G-forces, smell of petrol, feeling of the car, smell of the interior leather or Alcantara,...cant be simulated. Motion rigs cost around the price of a real car so thats not done. Hope everyone thats a car lover will own one day his dream car(s). Peace out stay safe ️

2020-09-16 21:17:24: > Would never be just a $50 difference. They need to get profit from something. I think that is it.
2020-09-16 21:26:22: > Jonathan Bezeau yeah I get that, but 100 is a lot thought in my opinion
2020-09-16 21:26:46: > My guess was they would take too much of a loss if they dropped the disk version to 450 so they put it for 500 to match Xbox's
2020-09-16 21:26:59: > Because you still have a choice.. Or if you don't like join xbox family.. Easy.. Xbox needed to make that move.. Put Xbox SS for $300 to raise the bar and make pressure to Playstation brand..
2020-09-16 21:35:56: > Disc drive is expensive my boy
2020-09-16 21:50:59: > Pretty obvious, Sony want you to buy the digital edition so you buy digital games and they get all the money instead of sharing them with shops
2020-09-16 22:12:29: > Because it was obvious and predictable...
2020-09-16 22:20:01: > Because it literally comes with a blue ray disk player
2020-09-16 22:20:13: > To encourage more people to go digital so they make more money. It's quite simple.
2020-09-16 22:26:08: > @Radacci Gaming Digital games r actually cheaper online here in Canada. Plus if u buy a game from the PS store they don't charge tax. Which makes it even more cheaper
2020-09-16 22:27:07: > @MycodenameisM not 100USD
2020-09-16 22:39:48: > im pretty sure unlike the series S the digital is just as powerful as the full price
2020-09-16 22:43:31: > They don't want anyone to buy the non-digital version. I am surprised it's not more of a difference. Kill the pre-owned market control the digital store and a six year old game will be $60 forever unless it's on sale. Pick a $10 game at Gamestop and it will be $30+ on PSN store.
2020-09-16 22:44:34: > I'll still buy the ps5 with disc drive I'm an old school guy
2020-09-16 22:48:00: > disc drive couldve been 299
2020-09-16 22:57:22: > That is what most people expected I'd say
2020-09-16 22:59:09: > @ErrorSZN Thats why it was speculated the Digital would cost 449$
2020-09-16 23:15:19: > Disk Drive. Most Likely Play your PS4 disc games. $100 is not bad. Getting one of each.
2020-09-16 23:16:25: > Im still getting the disc version because I like to collect physical games
2020-09-16 23:16:58: > @The Jugg What $10 game is worth playing? Buy the disc drive if disc games are important. Simple. Save $100 and face the consequences.
2020-09-16 23:18:28: > @Radacci Gaming Not really. No disc to print on. No plastic case to assemble. No shipping to stores. It's really cheaper and faster to deploy software this way. PC market has been doing it for years.
2020-09-16 23:31:39: > @raptalkdotnet as games age they lose value but games that are $10 at Gamestop are $40 to $70 on PSN. Meaning you will see less market pressure because of the pre-owned market leaving Sony to say leave the game at $60 forever.
2020-09-17 05:52:40: > @Nelson Geada XboxS i garbage though. If you don't have a 4k TV, you'll play games at 1080p, 30fps, which is prev gen. If you have a budget 4K TV, you're playing at nerfed res, with 60fps.
2020-09-17 05:56:52: > @raptalkdotnet that's what i would expect, but it's not the reality here, at least in Sweden. It's cheaper for me to order from online store; digital version is usually 5$ more, with next gen, duno.
2020-09-17 06:04:49: > @The Jugg uhm no? Games def don't cost 60$ forever. They have games at up to 80% sale, and under 10/20$ most of the time. You get games for free from PS+ As well, or extra price reduction.  Anyway, I'm undecided still. With disc version, i can borrow games for free at Library  and sell games, if i'm done with them, but i generally want to keep games anyway, but not fan of gathering dics.
2020-09-17 06:32:46: > PixelaGames2000 yeah same and because I have a lot of disc games on ps4 I still want to play on ps5
2020-09-20 23:07:48: > @Jonathan Bezeau a disk drive doesn't cost $100 us

2020-09-16 21:10:20: Me owning a gaming pc Ps4 fanbois down here:       Bruh
2020-09-16 21:10:24: If they really wanted to make people feel how big of a deal the PS5 is, they should have shown scenes from a PS1 game, then a PS2 game, then PS3, then PS4, and finally PS5 in all its glory.    This way Sony fanboys would stop jerking off and realize that the difference from one console to the next has been less each time, and we're finally to the point where it's negligeable.  The only reason to consider making the jump from PS4 to PS5 is that the new console is holding all these great games hostage.
2020-09-16 21:12:40: > Same with XBOX fanboys bro. Always chatting about power but just as you said, the difference is negligible.
2020-09-16 21:10:26: Why the f*ck are we 1 Week late in Europe. What did we wrong for f*ck sake?!
2020-09-16 21:10:30: I was here the day sony revealed the ps5 price
2020-09-16 21:44:46: > I was late that day.

2020-09-16 21:13:18: Im not at all impressed by the graphics and gameplay from what i can see here.  I know itll be years before theyll utilize the full power of the ps5.
2020-09-16 21:23:39: > Im totally with you. I spent the whole showcase thinking all the games look no better than current gen. Im not feeling these new consoles at all right now. Im wondering if the launch line ups and announcements would have been different without Coronavirus.
2020-09-16 21:39:15: > @Dan Jackson Exactly i don't know if corona is a reason or not but im glad u seen what i seen current gen graphics. Now i feel like waiting to the end of next yr to see what becomes of it.
2020-09-16 21:13:19: GG
2020-09-16 21:13:21: Not impressed so far. Some of these games look nothing like what Sony has been showing up prior. That FF and Hogwarts game looked like mobile games not something fitting of PS5.
2020-09-16 21:13:27: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa

2020-09-16 21:15:20: Time to buy a used PS4! Just for the exclusive games and stick with my PC for other games :')
2020-09-16 21:15:26: Every games edited well but atlast "RAGNAROK IS COMING" Stoled the whole event
2020-09-16 21:20:27: > Whats Ragnorak?
2020-09-16 21:15:26: We Will come back every year seeing the sales of PlayStation 5, Xbox Series and the New Nintendo console. Who Will win?? I think Sony Will Win. 17-9-2020
2020-09-16 22:08:50: > katerina zachariadou Sony will most likely sell more consoles but Xbox might make the money back with game pass and Nintendo games sell extremely well
2020-09-16 21:15:29: I was here
2020-09-16 21:15:32: So hyped for Demon's Souls
2020-09-16 21:36:40: > And elden rings!
2020-09-16 21:45:57: > Cant wait
2020-09-16 21:50:01: > Yes, demon souls looks amazing
2020-09-16 21:57:59: > Do you think it will be exclusive? I may have to buy one just for this if it is.
2020-09-16 22:02:06: > But it looks like it won't be available at launch?
2020-09-16 22:04:52: > @Jack Wakeham hoping that the "also available on pc" is true
2020-09-16 22:08:16: > @Jack Wakeham I am seeing a lot of outlets, including Game Informer saying i is a launch title and its coming to PC and other consoles later.
2020-09-16 22:16:03: > I love how the game looks ahead of its time graphically but mechanically it still plays just like og Demon Souls
2020-09-16 22:28:39: > Never played a Dark Souls game before but that looked SICK!
2020-09-16 22:51:13: > same
2020-09-17 00:52:10: > @Jack Wakeham the original was a ps3 exclusive so probably.
2020-09-16 21:15:34: Can they think of new pitches
2020-09-16 21:15:41: 1:43:25 GOTY   Welcome kratos to PS5
2020-09-16 21:15:43: 1:42:39 WHY IN EUROPE THEY MUST PAY THE EXACT SAME PRICE AS THE US ??? THATS STILL THE QUESTION BECAUSE THEY MUST PAY LESS NORMALLY , AND ENGLAND THEY CAN PAY LESS?? (talking about the number).   Sony just get money from people since day one , oh sorry its not just them its all the thing which came from United States that we must pay the exact same price even if its 20/30 euros more than what we must pay in reality !
2020-09-16 21:15:48: This was severely underwhelming. Its 100 bucks more than the xbox and the specs, although are close, are inferior to xbox series S and X. Really disappointed. The games looked great dont get me wrong but an inferior console at a much higher price? I just can't reason with it.
2020-09-16 21:15:52: Cadet spaget wants your baguette
2020-09-16 21:15:56: I wish to see one game about Lord of the rings

2020-09-16 21:16:18: Ok and now Sony... How many PS4 Titel will be fully playable on PS5 ? What's about the only 100 Titel you said in March?   How many PS4 games will be playable at launch? I personally will not preorder, before i have no idea, how many games (and which one) will be playable. Can i play MY PS4 library on PS5 ? How are WE able to check, if OUR games are playble ?   Will this be a thing like "hope your game is working" ? Or how can we check, which one works and which one does not?

2020-09-16 21:17:04: Rip Xbox
2020-09-16 21:17:04: So this is the day we all waited for for 7 years
2020-09-16 21:17:08: Demon souls baby

2020-09-16 21:21:06: > Johan Liebert i hope so
2020-09-16 21:17:21: Y e s
2020-09-16 21:17:23: No GTA6 
2020-09-16 21:17:27: PlayStation >>> Xbox
2020-09-16 21:17:31: So, when will GTA 6 be released?
2020-09-16 21:54:14: > they say its only 70% done we got a long wait
2020-09-16 21:54:28: > 2 or 3 years after the launch of ps5 and Series X.
2020-09-16 21:55:33: > may be in 4275
2020-09-16 22:10:14: > By 2023
2020-09-16 22:10:47: > Why you asking Sony? Ask rockstar games, buddy.
2020-09-16 22:18:47: > They are taking so long because people are buying in-game items and its making them millions. If its making them millions they are just adding new stuff instead of making a whole new game. Hence why we got a port to the PS5 so they can continue to milk GTA5
2020-09-16 22:44:11: > I was waiting for the R* logo to appear 
2020-09-16 22:50:20: > @Erne C. I don't understand the whole "they are just milking gta 5 statement" Don't you understand that they are making content for GTA 5 and RDR2 whilst they are working on GTA 6, either we get content for GTA 5 and RDR2 or we don't. This isn't impacting GTA 6 in any way. Rockstar want to push out new quality games as much as the fans want them, but it wouldn't be quality if we got a new GTA or RDR every year. Rockstar is a GIGANTIC company and only a small portion of it is working on DLC's (Thats why we don't get them so often)
2020-09-16 22:51:33: > probably never
2020-09-16 22:56:45: > FLUX If it really doesnt affect it. What happened to the PS4 GTA?
2020-09-16 23:01:20: > @Erne C. PS4 GTA? They worked on RDR2 for the PS4 that's what happened
2020-09-16 23:02:14: > @FLUX 𝗗𝗶𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗳𝗶𝘅 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴? I stopped playing it as everyone threw money bags at me & throwing me in the air etc with software hacks.  If Rock* didn't fix the online cheating then that really is scandalous from a multi million cash flowing factory.
2020-09-16 23:05:01: > FLUX I thought you said it didnt affect other games because they Studio was big? You are contradicting yourself 
2020-09-16 23:50:25: > @Erne C. Like i just said, RDR2 was the game rockstar worked on and planed to release on the PS4. there wasn't ever a "PS4 GTA" exept the rerelease of GTA 5
2020-09-16 21:17:32: starts at 59:18
2020-09-16 21:17:33: You can inform this to xbox: you are WAY out of your league.
2020-09-16 21:17:35: Rip xbox
2020-09-16 21:17:35: 1:43:25 .. And everybody went mad!!  Especially Xbox!
2020-09-16 21:17:37: Stream starts here boyz => 01:34:09
2020-09-16 21:17:50: I know Im probably in the minority here but I have seen nothing from either Sony or Microsoft that is convincing me even a little bit to buy one of their consoles at or near launch. This showcase did nothing to change that. It seemed like an awful lot of games that Ive already played on current gen and no exclusives that interest me. In fact am I right in thinking Miles Morales was the only exclusive they showed? I have never been as indifferent about the launch of new consoles as I am this year.
2020-09-16 21:17:57: Hey new me in 5 years just wanna say that you saw the price and release date reveal live

2020-09-16 21:23:08: > I know right?!

2020-09-16 21:36:10: > sony just casually dropped it at the end
2020-09-16 21:36:45: > Youre talking about hellblade?
2020-09-16 21:38:57: > XSX = 12 tflops PS5 = 8 tflops  xD
2020-09-16 21:43:57: > @Cordero PC =
2020-09-16 22:05:09: > You may? Pc = bankrupt
2020-09-16 22:13:08: > @Cordero tdh who cares about specs. My favourite console is my switch and it's not because it's the most powerful. It's because it has a lot of games I like.
2020-09-16 22:20:23: > @Darby Seymour no it doesnt. It only has Nintendo exclusives. Everything else you should buy for an Xbox PlayStation or pc.
2020-09-16 22:21:16: > Pleases elaborate
2020-09-16 22:21:44: > @TheAztecWarrior100 yeah definitely. But  the switch is still my favourite console because it has my favourite games on it.
2020-09-16 22:50:31: > xbox doesnt have games
2020-09-16 22:52:45: > @BlueFlag Alpha but your mom has alot of them
2020-09-16 22:57:19: > @Cordero PS5's HDD runs double the speed of xsx's teraflops are not everything!
2020-09-16 23:00:31: > @Sean Connery Avowed clone?
2020-09-16 23:08:29: > @Cordero ps5 = 10.4 teraflops  but ok
2020-09-16 23:21:31: > @Sean Connery dude you havent seen any gameplay of avowed
2020-09-16 23:24:02: > @Mr. AFM nope
2020-09-16 23:33:35: > @Darby Seymour Nintendo does not promise powerful systems, Sony and Microsoft do. That's why graphic comparisons will always be made between these two platforms.
2020-09-17 00:17:58: > @CorderoI agree that it will always be between them. I'm just saying that better graphics doesn't mean the games are better.  You could show me fallout 4 with the most beautiful graphics available. I'll still pick new Vegas because it's a better game.
2020-09-16 21:18:58: Rip Xbox and carig aka low budget thanos 
2020-09-16 21:18:59: Lets be honest we are buying digital edition

2020-09-16 21:33:28: > Same here im fkin hyped
2020-09-16 21:35:20: > When I saw blood on the kid, I was sure it was a Yoko Taro game :P
2020-09-16 21:36:22: > @Mr_Modesty by the way... His was Joshua... Ring a bell?
2020-09-16 21:37:50: > hope its better than FF15..
2020-09-16 21:39:35: > @BMW ///M Performance I liked FF15, but  seeing the trailer alone proofs that FFXVI will be superior!!!
2020-09-16 21:40:16: > Anyone knows what I'm talking about?
2020-09-16 21:43:22: > @Utopia of Gamers  doesn't it look kinda like the witcher but japanese?
2020-09-16 21:44:44: > @Joaquin Gerez to me, it looked like DmC a lot 
2020-09-16 21:52:00: > @Utopia of Gamers Can you help me remember?
2020-09-16 22:19:13: > Utopia of Gamers same, and it looks like 16 might have some connections to 15 (with the plague thing and the boy healing just like Ardyn did) I just hope it comes to PC sooner rather than later, i got a ps4 just for FF7 remake because of that 1 year exclusivity
2020-09-16 21:19:41: Why PS5? Price: 399$ & 499$ (same as Xbox series x) Benefits: amazing looking games 3d audio Haptic touch dual sense controller Unbeatable list of games  Who cares about extra 2 Tflops anyways?
2020-09-16 21:27:54: > When your girlfriend tells you not to worry about that other guy situation right here. You already question your decision and did not even buy it yet. Those 2 tf will make the xbox the better console it the long run. Great games nonetheless on ps5
2020-09-16 21:28:04: > Sorry, Xbox series s 299,99 $
2020-09-16 21:30:17: > @Ro Drawing What is the point of having the better console when you have no games worth playing? The only cool thing they had was Halo and they royally screwed themselves.
2020-09-16 21:31:05: > Also Xbox series s 4 Tflops. And yet again  who cares about the extra 2 Tflops. Ps5 take my money
2020-09-16 21:31:32: > Xbox users
2020-09-16 21:35:21: > @Charlo Rivard royally screwed is the most accurate way to explain xbox's situation. I respect both console user nevertheless from all aspects PS5 is the best buy. November 12th cant wait!!!
2020-09-16 21:19:46: Jim Ryan "It's your passion of fans of gaming that drives us to deliver a truly new generation of experiences on PS5 from everyone at PlayStation we appreciate your support" (unless your in the November 19th release date then you can just wait an Extra week)....Nice to be appreciated.

2020-09-16 21:20:00: Why it so expensive?
2020-09-16 21:20:00: I wish they told something about playstation now and how they are going to compete with the xbox gamepass
2020-09-16 21:20:06: 59:16 you're welcome
2020-09-16 21:20:07: Take a bow, xbox there's always a next generation battle back to the drawing boards.
2020-09-16 21:20:19: See you in the future!

2020-09-16 21:20:25: Is there a chance to create more games without violance or darkness?
2020-09-16 21:20:29: no socom no bf6?? :(
2020-09-16 21:20:35: *Harry Potter is better than HALO my Brother  !*
2020-09-16 21:20:43: 59:18 is the real start, the rest is B.S. from sony!! REALLY 59 MINUTES OF MUSIC! NO CRIATIVITY AT ALL! JUST B.S.!
2020-09-16 21:29:24: > They were waiting for people to join
2020-09-16 21:20:53: Hogwarts Legacy looks amazing! I waited for so long!!
2020-09-16 21:20:56: So far the games seem kind of trash
2020-09-16 21:20:56: Im waiying for the fnaf breach bc i realy love fnaf
2020-09-16 21:21:02: The reason i will buy PS5 is for the new Horrizon game!
2020-09-16 21:21:03: mfs were sayin fortnite 2 
2020-09-16 21:21:12: AMAZING 
2020-09-16 21:21:17: Risky move by Sony being 100 more in price than the Series S. With so many families losing a lot of money from lockdown and Covid, I for one can barely afford to splash out on the Series S. At least MS have the financing option making Xbox more accessible to the millions who can't afford any of them.
2020-09-16 21:21:17: i can say i was here for the PS5 launch video.
2020-09-16 21:21:20: COD was the only game worth buying.  Pass..
2020-09-16 21:21:23: Can I play games form PS 4 ? on PS 5 ? Thanks :)
2020-09-16 21:21:23: It's crazy they really try to make everybody go digital sorry I'm old school but that's a big difference for a disc and no disc $100 difference.
2020-09-16 21:26:09: > Imo 100 bucks is nothing in the long run. Buying only digital and unless they give you the option to sell it after you buy it then its not worth the digital version
2020-09-16 21:26:12: > thats what i said, you can save $100 just to do what most already do. Most people don't really buy disc anymore so its a win win
2020-09-16 21:28:07: > @LUC1D TOUR  I feel what you saying but I still love the physical of a dish 20 years from now I can show kids that this is the dish systems break Even though you got cloud storage I don't know I'm just old school I like the physical copy
2020-09-16 21:29:45: > @LUC1D TOUR talk for youself.. Console with disc everyday..
2020-09-16 21:31:16: > Nelson Geada well I did say most, there is a reason why GameStop is going out of business
2020-09-16 21:32:05: > @LUC1D TOUR people don't really buy disks you say? Everyone I know who owns a console will always buy the second hand disk and 50% the price no matter what you say. You can really save hundreds of dollars like this. That 100 dollars is nothing. If you can't afford that 100 dollars maybe the console is too expensive for your budget. Honestly now. How do you expect to game on it? 100 dollars is like 1 and a half aaa game
2020-09-16 21:21:27: Soluls are looking great
2020-09-16 21:21:38: Wait, what about persona 5 royal?
2020-09-16 21:21:47: Fghip Jj
2020-09-16 21:21:50: I hope most ps4 discs are compatible
2020-09-16 21:21:51: Not gonna lie, Gordon Ramsey's dad be doing work with his console
2020-09-16 22:48:56: > Selling it down the river putting all its games on PC
2020-09-16 22:54:58: > Mr SammyB all of them? Only a few of them lol
2020-09-17 00:05:47: > Hahahahaha! You made chuckle hard my prosthetic tooth falls off!
2020-09-16 21:21:56: Okay RE VILLAGE Second trailer Fnaf Security Branch And many more a new epic games coming soon!   But, im still not look a trailer New Game Silent Hill GTA6  
2020-09-16 21:22:00: Ok, so are all those holiday 2020 games coming November 12th basically as well.
2020-09-16 21:22:00: So how much are the games going to be ? Are the digital ones going to  cost more than the physical copies ?
2020-09-16 21:22:01: The 1:42:27 minute soundrack is epic as a futuristic touch on this well-made console sony
2020-09-16 21:22:02: This was worth the wait. Thank you!
2020-09-16 21:22:08: That Harry Potter game and Miles Morales game was the best part of 2020 game show
2020-09-16 21:22:19: Playstation is always awesome!
2020-09-16 21:22:32: 1:46:04 whoa, chill.
2020-09-16 21:22:34: Welp the console wars are back!
2020-09-16 22:19:56: > Ugh don't remind me
2020-09-16 21:22:36: No where is silent hill ?
2020-09-16 21:22:42: What is the outro song?
2020-09-16 21:22:46: Noice my wallet gonna hate me 4 a while but hopefully it will be worth it (won't be a jet)
2020-09-16 21:22:54: This was and will always be a POG in gaming.
2020-09-16 21:22:56: The PS7 looks cool af
2020-09-16 21:22:59: That Harry Potter game and Miles Morales game was the best part of 2020 game show. So Glad Harry Potter game is finally coming
2020-09-16 21:23:03: I better comment to this video, or ill regret not commenting on this peice of history right here!!
2020-09-16 21:23:08: Sony is like a vindictive EX who won't be satisfied until XBOX is crushed. Meanwhile XBOX moved on with game pass and is ahead at least 3 years with this service. Now Sony is bravely showing console exclusive available only on PS5 and MICROSOFT WINDOWS 10 haha
2020-09-16 21:23:09: Anyone who disliked this is definitely an Xbot
2020-09-16 21:23:09: NICE
2020-09-16 21:23:10: Is the campaign for the new cod cold war offline?
2020-09-16 21:23:12: FF16 seemed ok but reminded me a lot of 15 and I was disappointed in that game, Harry potter game somewhat interests me but overall I wasnt impressed with what was shown.
2020-09-16 22:00:08: > Well, it seems they took all the bad stuff from FF15, and fixed it.
2020-09-16 22:16:56: > Even gow????!
2020-09-16 21:23:14: Fact: This video will be in our recommended in exactly 7 years before the release of ps6
2020-09-16 21:33:09: > If the world is still existing by that time.
2020-09-16 21:33:32: > Mr Dylan true.
2020-09-16 21:34:21: > Wrd
2020-09-16 22:53:27: > if we are still alive 7 years later
2020-09-16 21:23:18: As an European customer I feel disappointment that we will get it later-
2020-09-16 21:23:37: This is so amazing!!!!! PlayStation is the best!!!!!
2020-09-16 21:23:38: BOOOOOIIIIIIII, TIME HAS COMEEEE

2020-09-16 21:23:43: I will. Come back and like this comment next year..  Hi new me..
2020-09-16 21:23:45: Sony said if 1,000 people like this comment, they will give me a free PS5!!!!!            Not really, but a man can dream.
2020-09-16 21:23:46: Wait... Soo its all PlayStation?
2020-09-16 21:25:47: > Always has been
2020-09-16 21:26:22: > Thanks alot.
2020-09-16 21:23:50: The video starts in 1:00:00 mark guys just to save yall from all the waiting. Just watched the whole video, I'm not that impressed. Only 1 game I like, which is Resident Evil, and honestly the rest of those games look like ps4.
2020-09-16 21:23:52: Here before one million views
2020-09-16 21:24:01: 59:18 start
2020-09-16 21:24:01: Ehhh
2020-09-16 21:24:05: Start here: 59:13
2020-09-16 21:24:05: May you just tell us the price of the ps5
2020-09-16 21:24:07: I like Sony 
2020-09-16 21:24:09: PS5 
2020-09-16 21:24:12: من یک ایرانی هستم و در تاریخ رونمایی از کنسول جدید سونی در اینجا حضور داشتم . شب رویایی بود
2020-09-16 21:24:16: Sony, please let evolution studios comeback! Imagine driveclub 2 on the ps5!!!
2020-09-16 21:24:19: How much  in uk price?
2020-09-16 21:24:22: Starts at 59:20
2020-09-16 21:24:24: Kinda remind me FFV main protagonist just because of his hair
2020-09-16 21:24:36: The price was as I expected 
2020-09-16 21:24:42: RIP Xbox. Get better bro!!!!! Lol
2020-09-16 21:24:46: Well my bill only can with the xbox series S :(
2020-09-16 21:24:59: It's official, Sony hates the UK, why the week later release date? Xbox is worldwide, you've lost this generation.
2020-09-16 21:30:59: > It doesnt make much sense but to be fair its only a week. I remember the SNES launching in Japan in November 1990 and having to wait until April 1992 for the UK release! A week is nothing.
2020-09-16 21:47:05: > @Dan Jackson You've got a point comparing to older generations release dates were all over the show. Have to say I'm not as bothered this generation, bought the PS4 on launch, but no desire with the PS5? I'm going to wait until they release the Pro version this time round, none of the games appeal so far.
2020-09-16 21:25:06: I don't understand ... Paid backward compatibility?  Not all PS4 games yet? !!!  Are you seriously?!!!!
2020-09-16 21:29:39: > What?
2020-09-16 21:25:17: If I can't sell my pro I might just give it someone  that's down on their luck because I've had fun with the ps4
2020-09-16 22:53:55: > Give it to me bro
2020-09-16 23:01:48: > Seal it to me price?
2020-09-16 23:20:32: > Can I have it please?
2020-09-16 23:21:32: > Bro if your down to give it away I'm begging you bro plz plz plz plz plz may I have it bro I always wanted a PS4
2020-09-16 23:25:51: > keep that boi, it should go on the shelf and be a nice reminder.
2020-09-16 23:26:21: > Brah you need to give it to them xbots they need it
2020-09-16 23:33:34: > You should treasure that dude
2020-09-16 23:33:45: > Hook a brother up
2020-09-16 23:38:24: > I'm trading in my PS4 to serve as credit towards a PS5 Disc edition. My Internet acts weird at times so I'm getting a disc version of the PS5 just to be safe.

2020-09-16 21:26:29: PS5 with this Showcase : PS5 vs Xbox Series X : Finish Him (Smash the Xbox with a Sledgehammer into pieces) Flawless Victory! Perfect! (No I have all console i don't care about the console wars just be objective. Xbox has nothing to offer just nothing)    That was the final blow. Amazing. Phenomenal. Masterpieces. Nothing else to say about PS5. Best Like always. This showcase blowing my mind. Congratulations for the price in USA. I am very happy for you. Here in Canada like always we gonna pay like double. 599$ + all taxes + Buy on Amazon + Shipping = Just the console its like 700$. So not day 1 for me. Probably wait 1 or 2 years the price drop in a huge way. Just sad here in Canada same at the end of his life PS4 sill cost over 500$. I'm glad for Americans people who will be able to enjoy the PS5 November 12th. You are so lucky

2020-09-16 21:28:36: Sony   Why didn't you put the PSVR port on the back of the system.  4K 120FPS VRR - for your cutting edge users... !!! (Who probably ALSO own a PSVR and won't be able to use any of what I just said if that is plugged in).
2020-09-16 22:18:40: > Yeah I have no idea what you're talking about. There was so many grammatical errors that I didn't understand a word you just said. Will the psvr work with the PS5?

2020-09-16 21:29:06: i was going to get a pc...
2020-09-16 21:46:03: > Going to...
2020-09-16 21:29:07: I personally would have like to see more from Playstation Studios.  Instead of 4+ minutes of COD, I would have liked more from an Exclusive like Horizon or Gran Turismo. And I was hoping to see if these SOCOM rumors are true...certainly didn't tune in to see an announcement for Fortnite.   I am still very excited for PS5, but I will wait until 2021. In my opinion NONE of the next gen consoles are worthy of a launch window purchase.
2020-09-16 22:32:41: > you play h-hour? it will scratch one or 2 itches for socom.
2020-09-16 22:39:58: > @Stoke I will look into it. Thanks

2020-09-17 06:32:24: > Yellow Devil so you are an American. I only asked what did he mean. And btw its only harassing if you wake up and your naibour has his face up against the window multiple times
2020-09-16 21:29:44: I love Sony PlayStation!
2020-09-16 21:29:55: Im gonna be honest I still dont know if that was a new Final Fantasy or a remake
2020-09-16 22:09:55: > It was a new Final Fantasy. What would it had been a remake of?
2020-09-21 18:03:31: > Grand Master Farmer an older Final Fantasy
2020-09-21 19:35:00: > @thisguynamedbrian It's brand new.
2020-09-16 21:29:56: No SOCOM ?

2020-09-16 21:30:23: Well that was disappointing.

2020-09-16 21:31:17: 0:01 PS5 Background Theme  My Rumours   Edit: Yes, the theme is really comfortable
2020-09-16 21:46:16: > DeadManQ8 it does sound alot more improved and alot less intense than the ps4
2020-09-16 21:52:54: > I probably wont even play anything, just sit there and enjoy the ambient music coming from the theme
2020-09-16 21:53:00: > @MONKEYrudders 09 I agree with that

2020-09-16 21:31:45: This is gonna be the most well spent 500$ of my life.

2020-09-16 21:53:07: > @Bendak Starkiller W
2020-09-16 22:24:04: > @Bendak Starkiller Or nice shoes maybe
2020-09-16 22:25:43: > @Bendak Starkiller, 500 for a whole system that comes with a controller or 500 for just a gpu. Come on man, pcs are great but pricing is where consoles take the cake.
2020-09-16 22:51:26: > 400$ for the digital version
2020-09-16 22:57:02: > @Tio Einstein I ignore digital version. I love my physical media and will 100% stay to physical as long as it's an option. And when it stops being an option I will likely become an old school gamer playing all the stuff I didn't play before on consoles I already own. I hate digital way of doing things where ownership is taken from you as well as freedom in how/where/when you play your games. Friends should be able to borrow games from eachother and cheaper used games should always be a thing so people with less income can still properly enjoy gaming. Digital only is a greedy buisness. Wont support.

2020-09-16 23:38:33: > what would they bundle? spider-man is not out on day 1.
2020-09-16 21:31:59: Spider-Man is trying too hard.  Less effort, more lack of effort.

2020-09-16 21:36:02: Seriously? A last-minute showcase created to announce the prices and a bunch of games (previously announced btw)? Just for Sony can take some of Xbox momentum?   The only new thing here was Sony's new paid service (clear competition to GamePass, so nothing new)
2020-09-16 23:35:33: > "new paid service"? its just ps+. and 18 old games are competing with 350 games and "day 1 on gamepass" launches? sure....

2020-09-16 21:40:20: 1:43:24   Youre Welcome
2020-09-16 21:40:32: back when these fellas thoughts that the ps5 was the best console you don't even know what happened in the futu....... whoops
2020-09-16 21:40:34: the people just discovering ps5..
2020-09-16 21:40:38: I'm still praying for a Bloodborne 2......!!!
2020-09-16 23:28:01: > that was already debunked by fromsoftware.
2020-09-16 23:43:47: > @Yellow Devil people pray for things that aren't happening all the time. Just cuz it's been debunked doesn't mean I'm not gonna stop dreaming. Lol.
2020-09-16 21:40:43: Wow a Harry Potter game thats not a Lego one I can remember the last time we had one of those
2020-09-16 21:58:47: > i remember way back on the PSone with that harry potter game where hagrid was a block made up of like 12 polygons, that's the last time i can recall a full on harry potter game that wasn't shovelware
2020-09-16 22:02:18: > 2004
2020-09-16 22:02:26: > I mean it's not actually a harry potter game but still super exciting to see what they will do with the next gen features. Wizard world missed a whole generation :(
2020-09-16 22:03:12: > @Lachlan haha played it and have loved it
2020-09-16 22:03:16: > This game has been rumored for a while now and I'm finally glad that they not only confirmed but showed the game off.
2020-09-16 22:04:44: > @Psychonaut97 i miss when licensed games were actually half decent. i should dig up a copy of that game to replay haha it was so fun!
2020-09-16 22:04:59: > @Lachlan hagrid looked like a mountain in that.
2020-09-16 22:05:48: > @Lachlan *Fancy some tea?*
2020-09-16 22:07:09: > @RoboCario RIGHT? so glad i grew up to see all those early polygons as a kid haha, gave every game kind of a "toy" feel if you get me. everything is so clean now but back then low polygon games kind of gave off vibes like the game itself was a toy. take the Buzz Lightyear to the rescue licensed game for a great example. you were a literal toy with the dodgiest graphics but it was great jumping around a huge house being only the size of Buzz
2020-09-16 22:07:36: > @Oats Curry Summer Dish YOU JUST UNLOCKED A MEMORY FOR ME I FORGOT I HAD FOR DECADES
2020-09-16 22:07:44: > The ps2 one was very fun it was the order of the Phoenix
2020-09-16 22:11:12: > Im excited for this game!
2020-09-16 22:11:54: > @King The German Shepherd 2011
2020-09-16 22:15:45: > DO NOT BUY THE Harry Potter game. Don't Help finance transphobia. JK Rowling is a TERF.
2020-09-16 22:32:10: > Thanks 
2020-09-16 22:34:43: > 2004
2020-09-16 22:45:54: > Yeah... It's been a long time since we got that half assed Deathly Hollows game. This one.. thought not HP as the main character... looks amazing.
2020-09-16 22:53:09: > And one thats not a forced retelling of a book to boot. Im excited.
2020-09-16 22:54:51: > The Bear Geek that aint helping much anymore, she already got a mad amount of money
2020-09-16 22:55:22: > Veryoriginal it is coming to PS4 as well
2020-09-16 23:02:06: > King The German Shepherd 2012* with Deathly Hallows
2020-09-16 23:09:34: > If youre not counting Harry Potter for the Kinect, Book of speed, and Book Potions the last Harry Potter game was in 2011
2020-09-16 23:20:51: > I wasn't impressed! Kinda lame!
2020-09-16 23:38:06: > the last one i really remember is the one for the kinect, that was really bad
2020-09-17 00:06:17: > @Lachlan those are the sexiest 12 polygons this world has ever seen
2020-09-17 00:36:49: > @Lachlan wrong ps2 had one also
2020-09-17 00:37:38: > Isaiah Allen im talking specifically about harry potter and the philosopher stone on the PSone
2020-09-17 01:02:44: > @Lachlan That game was legit. The fight against voldemort/quirrell was dope.   Mash triangle to get out of his death grip!!!!
2020-09-19 15:30:07: > Hey those Lego games are amazing
2020-09-29 08:27:40: > @Martin Aguilar I was very impressed! Kinda cool!

2020-09-17 03:20:15: > Anonymous Passerby The execution in the beginning with loud rifle rounds that somehow wasn't heard by the entire security team was pretty baffling as well.
2020-09-17 03:31:13: > @Temp 296O15 it wasnt before, they cut out the beginnning, new one is 19:07
2020-09-16 21:41:37: All the dislikes are from Xbox people

2020-09-16 21:41:47: Bro, I just want fortnite
2020-09-16 21:41:59: Buying the Ps5 only for Spider-Man Miles Morales no cap
2020-09-16 21:42:06: What about Pre-order?
2020-09-16 21:42:10: pretty much everything they showed is either on PC PS4 or not exclusive  I think they showed 1 game that was if this was a Xbox event people would be calling this garbage and saying I can  get them on PC or one  ps.
2020-09-16 21:42:14: I was curious when are they gonna show in-depth analysis of the UI and BC info. Teardown as well. Been months they've been quiet to it. But awesome show, Sony.
2020-09-16 22:28:47: > Analysis of the UI and BC info  Ugh I know, right? They need to stop being quiet
2020-09-16 23:12:52: > I think thats next
2020-09-16 23:27:36: > The preorders are open. They just want people to buy without really knowing the details. Such a weird way of doing business or selling something.
2020-09-17 00:04:52: > Coz the UI is the same as ps4 with pretty colours
2020-09-17 06:31:10: > @Scruffa Stuff They confirmed it'll be a 100% overhaul to the PS4, so it'll look completely different.
2020-09-16 21:42:15: Ps5 
2020-09-16 21:42:15: Finally I can afford the PS4 Slim

2020-09-16 21:42:46: Lol the same price for less! Boy o boy. Their stock price didn't even raise back up after Bloomberg put the obvious supply chain manufacturing retardation into black and white. I really thought this little doodoo presentation would artificially inflate the share price back to where it was before it dropped . lol . I guess not. The pretend perceived superiority of PlayStation only existed in the perception of Dum dums, but it appears that now even that ground is being lost.  That financial reality seasoned with inevitability seems like it should go down easier, stop choking on these facts PlayStation fans.
2020-09-16 21:42:51: GTA6 PS6?!
2020-09-16 21:42:53: I was here when they announced the ps5

2020-09-16 21:49:18: Yes 400 for digi edition thank christ that's a bargain for all those exclusives can't wait
2020-09-16 21:49:22:  *Literally EVERYTHING here looks like it could easily run on the 1X maybe even the pro, especially with it all looking 30FPS, I THOUGHT THIS WAS SUPPOSED to be next gen???, WHAT???*
2020-09-16 21:49:24: I was here when the prices were announced. That's going in the books
2020-09-16 22:55:55: > Same here
2020-09-16 23:19:34: > What was the general reaction?
2020-09-16 23:30:50: > Amor Alexandria The whole chat was hype. A lot of people saying RIP Xbox and some salty Xbox players trying to argue back. You simply cannot argue with that 400$ price point.
2020-09-16 23:47:44: > Corrupt Fate tbh Im an Xbox player I honestly really respect PlayStation for competing really hard with Xbox, to be completely honest I thought the ps5 was gonna be much more expensive
2020-09-16 23:48:35: > Me too
2020-09-17 00:18:38: > Sameee
2020-09-17 00:25:33: > Corrupt Fate Nice, I didnt catch the price.
2020-09-17 00:36:02: > Same buddy, and I'm not even a PlayStation gamer. I'm an Xbox Player. Witnessing the official price for this system alone was hype level. Especially on the way they revealed it with a dramatic touch. Loved it!
2020-09-17 00:42:33: > Corrupt Fate yeh but I would assume the Australian price is still horrible
2020-09-17 00:53:25: > why were ppl saying rip xbox when their models cost 500 and 300? can someone clarify?
2020-09-17 00:54:50: > @Barerwolf Yeah it will be, in the same way that £449 converts to $582 american
2020-09-17 00:55:03: > @Cloud ж xbox entry level has a lot of downgrade. playstation two model basically same spec only disc difference.
2020-09-17 01:10:43: > @zkg03mjmk thx for clarifying. tho i think that someone who wants to buy an entry lvl console cares more about the price than the power.
2020-09-17 01:12:47: > Corrupt Fate the Xbox s is les what do you mean
2020-09-16 21:49:41: 1:35:19 One Strike Man

2020-09-16 21:49:57: Must. Get. Final Fantasy. XVI
2020-09-16 21:50:12: Proof that I was here when Sony revealed the price for the PS5.
2020-09-16 21:50:24: Feel like that was definitely one of their better shows! It's about time we had a great Harry Potter adventure game! Cannot wait to join Slytherin and stab all my friends in the back >:)
2020-09-16 22:40:11: > I'M NOT EVEN A HARRY POTTER FAN AND IT LOOKED INSANEEEE
2020-09-16 23:03:02: >  
2020-09-16 23:24:28: > How dare you Harry !
2020-09-16 23:36:04: > TEAM SLYTHERIN YAS
2020-09-17 01:35:20: > Joining Griffindyor and fighting to defend the innocent from evil. And I'll probably pick up skills to befriend fantastical beasts.
2020-09-16 21:50:32: How much is it
2020-09-16 22:01:34: > 499$ with the disc drive, 399$ without it.
2020-09-16 21:50:40: Fairly average reveal, nothing really to see.
2020-09-16 21:50:40: Nothing special only repeating games in better graphics quaility, maybe xbox nailed it with gold subscription, i think its better
2020-09-16 22:00:59: > you mean xbox gamepass with its 350 games. not gold.
2020-09-17 05:32:46: > @Yellow Devil yes

2020-09-16 21:51:32: Releases on my birthday 12th
2020-09-16 21:51:35: I feel like 2021 and 2022 are going to be the greatest times for gaming.
2020-09-16 21:55:53: > or it will be 2020 season 2
2020-09-16 22:09:30: > @BLUE FIRE 2020.2
2020-09-16 22:29:39: > I really don't... At least from a PlayStation perspective. Maybe. Ratchet & Clank is the only game I'm excited about... Technically there'd be more games than before, but I'm just really not excited about many titles they showed at all.  If Ridge Racer came back and it's not like another burnout version, I'd be really excited about that.
2020-09-16 22:59:05: > There won't be a 2021 only 2020 part 2
2020-09-16 23:22:13: > 2008 - 2013 was the best.
2020-09-16 23:22:35: > KidneyTickler lol
2020-09-16 23:24:37: > 90's was golden age, 2007-2013 were better times, and recently with all of the older games/franchises getting remastered I think the industry is realizing we left something behind in our games, and I think that was the passion/heart/soul that people used to put into games.
2020-09-16 23:50:52: > Going to be difficult to top 1998 and 2001.
2020-09-17 02:17:54: > @Giga Force Why those specifically? I do say Crash Bandicoot Warped was back in 1998 but what was up with 2001?
2020-09-17 02:32:11: > GamerBot125  These were two prolific years as it contained tons of games that were rated highly and still talked about to this very day.  1998 releases:   Resident Evil 2, Metal Gear Solid, Half-Life, MediEvil, Parasite Eve, Xenogears, Baldurs Gate, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Banjo-Kazooie, StarCraft, Tenchu: Stealth Assassin, Spyro the Dragon, Fallout 2, Thief: The Dark Project, Panzer Dragoon Saga, F-Zero X,  Turok 2, Radiant Silvergun

2020-09-16 21:56:35: > They just said there will be new zombies gamode when ps5 release
2020-09-16 21:52:03: Love Playstation and Love Xbox but the launch titles look poor. Final Fantasy and Demons souls look awesome tho.
2020-09-16 21:55:49: > What about horizon or spider man
2020-09-16 22:32:22: > @Harry the Irish lad spiderman looks hood but be very short . They should of re released spuderman and gave Miles as dlc. Horizon looks awesome but that will release wayyyy next year.

2020-09-16 21:54:41: > No there are loads more they were on the last showcase
2020-09-16 21:52:44: I rather Sony Interactive Entertainment keep all their exclusives in house to avoid devaluing the PlayStation brand.  Congratulations Jim Ryan & Hermen Hulst for completely destroying the entire PlayStation legacy others have built through out the years with your whole turning console exclusives into pc/multiplatform releases which are very moronic choices just for a quick buck.
2020-09-16 21:52:47: Santa monica have just ended the console war

2020-09-16 21:56:11: PS5 10flops 400$ > xbox s 4flops 300$
2020-09-16 21:56:12: Well you have to pay $400.00 for the console.... then games that are $40.00-$60.00.... then your PlayStation plus... is it really worth it?
2020-09-16 21:56:15: best for my devil may cry 5  
2020-09-16 21:56:20: 1:43:30 basically the best thing ever and it made my day, i'm glad i have seen this
2020-09-16 21:56:21: Yes sur
2020-09-16 21:56:24: Ok. Overpriced for a console not as powerful as series x but preorders when?
2020-09-16 21:59:07: > Nobody cares about the shitbox
2020-09-16 22:10:42: > Its more about the games and the things it comes with

2020-09-17 01:14:48: > Thanks, buy the console, buy ps plus buy the toys, buy the games, buy the dlc, buy the remaster, buy the remake, buy the port, buy season tickets. You're not a real fan if you don't this, you must consume

2020-09-16 21:56:52: PRE-ORDERS START tomorrow @8AM
2020-09-16 21:57:07: What was that horror game at around 1:20:00 in the snow looks insane
2020-09-16 21:58:59: > Resident evil 8
2020-09-16 22:02:34: > @TheDragonProphet no not that one, the one with the granma
2020-09-16 22:03:43: > @Raizen what? The only horror game in this whole showcase feauturing snow is resident evil 8
2020-09-16 22:05:58: > @TheDragonProphet this one 1:22:00
2020-09-16 22:09:38: > @Raizen yes thats still resident evil 8 lol
2020-09-16 22:15:11: > @TheDragonProphet lol k thx
2020-09-16 21:57:17: Some of the graphics were great, as to be expected, but overall this was pretty underwhelming. No surprises. Each new generation there's less variety in gameplay ideas.
2020-09-16 22:00:19: > Your garbage opinion is noted and immediately discarded.
2020-09-16 21:57:24: Maybe next time if we dont ask for BC theyll give it to us. Kinda disappointed with all the teases pointing to it ngl. That was a selling point for me, and Im gonna have to pass on this one since my PS4 and PS3 still work just fine. I dont want 3 consoles sitting on my TV stand.
2020-09-16 21:57:30: Xbox RIP again
2020-09-16 21:57:48: Soooo... Y'all took down the Demon's trailer because negative comments started poppin' up or something? LOL

2020-09-16 23:11:03: > @Harry the Irish lad he means the pc games and timed exclusives.
2020-09-16 21:59:36: I was excited about pretty much nothing in this trailer, just the PS5 and Ratchet & Clank.
2020-09-16 21:59:53: Omfg that harry potter game looks amazing!!!!
2020-09-16 22:02:32: > Aye aye captain!

2020-09-16 22:00:18: For devil may cry v special do I need buy it or is it free at launch, also is it going to be like the fourth games special edition which was basically just the same game with the same enemies in the same format just with Virgil available to play with along with Trish because if so then I have no need to buy another basically exact copy of the game except I can play with Virgil
2020-09-16 22:00:20: The best console
2020-09-16 22:00:33: > I agree
2020-09-16 22:01:10: > But even though I agree with you dont like your own posts
2020-09-16 22:00:26: $399 it is then....Can't wait
2020-09-16 22:00:35: Can't wait for GTA VI, gameplay looks sick
2020-09-16 22:00:35: Now all those people posting price memes can relax. Paty's over folks.
2020-09-16 23:18:46: > 500$ is too much for a simple disc drive.
2020-09-16 23:50:34: > @Yellow Devil then don't buy a simple disc drive my friend.
2020-09-16 23:53:32: > @kashif naveed cant buy the digital edition. i dont buy disc games since 2015 BUT i buy all of my movies on 4k bluerays... so yeah... i feel ripped off on the pricing.
2020-09-16 22:00:44: Demon Souls at 1:34:00
2020-09-16 22:01:02: I'm Soooo Hyped
2020-09-16 22:01:29: RIP Xbox series x
2020-09-16 22:01:31: The presentation was ok but the games didnt make me feel euphoric about them mostly because all of them, except maybe Spiderman and FF16, are coming to PC and Xbox Series x +Current-Gen. I think I will just stick to PC and get a Series X OR PS5  in the near future if there are many great exclusives for either Xbox Series X or PS5...
2020-09-16 22:34:29: > Bruh
2020-09-16 22:01:39: Xbox have be  smachad 
2020-09-16 22:01:53: wow miles morales gameplay is a huge step up from spider man PS4! super excited! wow I'm super surprised all the prices are relatively the same in each country. living in Japan I thought the yen price would be way more than the dollar but it's not!
2020-09-16 22:02:05: честное слово по играм провал полный для sony ничего нового, ничего не меняеться , только детализация растет в графическом плане, в остальном другом только деградация
2020-09-16 22:02:23: I think i made my decision and going to get the digital version cause i dont remember the last time i used a CD
2020-09-16 22:05:00: > I havent used a cd since, the last time i saw a cd player
2020-09-16 22:02:23: Biggest question is can i get it in black?
2020-09-16 22:02:26: Listen I'm excited for dark souls, but not for beating it. I'm just ready to get stumped into the ground with new graphics.

2020-09-16 23:17:48: > seams to have lost its exclusivity to pc and or timed exclusive.
2020-09-16 23:21:14: > Yellow Devil no official announcement yet but unfortunately it seems that way :/
2020-09-16 22:02:43: If you guys get Bloodborne running at 60fps or higher and can also get the online features to work better then I'd be sold, Demon's Souls or not.  The Demon's Souls remake does look great though.

2020-09-16 22:05:08: $100 for a disc.

2020-09-16 22:05:35: Ahh crud, nothing that interests me enough to purchase a ps5 , if you've played as many games as i Have none of these are new or unique :/
2020-09-16 22:06:21: > If you only play RTS games like me you don't buy a console you stick with PC.

2020-09-16 22:06:12: i and a few others were the only ones in the chat that predicted fnaf security breach
2020-09-16 22:06:13: Not a bad price I was expecting 600-700 for some reason
2020-09-16 22:06:56: > Then you could just get a pc with an RTX 3000 gpu. 600-700 would be suicide.
2020-09-16 22:13:07: > @Wagner I prefer playstation exclusives and playing a console. I had a pc for 4 years but sold it because I never used it
2020-09-16 22:06:22: Ps2 vs ps5??? For me still its ps2 10 billion percent
2020-09-16 22:06:22: Даже я бы мог концепцию какой то игры сделать поинтереснее и оригинальнее

2020-09-16 22:16:13: What about backward compatibility? Where's 1080p@60fps for Uncharted 4 and Bloodborne with even framepacing? What is the list for backward compat. games? Will it transfer my saves and trophies from PS4? Why Spider-Man addon is like 'new game' and in 30 fps? Where are the new titles? Demon's Souls with strange mechanics and camera? Hogwarts in 2021? What else? Spider-Man addon? And that's all for you today? What's up with UI and backend? Can I finally buy a full bundle if I own a game + several DLCs?
2020-09-16 22:16:14: I wished the online multi-player would be free

2020-09-16 22:17:45: Why tf does PlayStation exist. All they do is take games for themselves so no one on pc or Xbox can play them. Imagine if everyone owned a pc. Itd be so much better
2020-09-16 22:17:49: no ui reveal though
2020-09-16 22:17:50: Ummmm if the PS5 says the speed of their load time is fast...but this showcase is one of the slowest showcase Ive watched...1 hour of nothing...   Well it is time for me to switch to XBOX :) see you PlayStation...
2020-09-16 22:17:50: Wow

2020-09-16 22:18:13: YO INFAMOUS ON THE PS5
2020-09-16 22:18:29: Very nice how this is only 30 fps. In freaking 1080p! This must be the future or something. Where's the advertised 4k120 every console player believes?       Oh wait...      How about 8k60 with a 3090? or true 4k120. Haters gonna hate of course.
2020-09-16 22:22:33: > BTW it's great to pay 90$ extra in Europe.
2020-09-16 22:18:29: RIP Xbox lol, there is no way xbox can compete with ps5
2020-09-17 02:00:28: > you mean the ps4 games like horizon 2 and miles morales? hm...will look great on last gen.
2020-09-16 22:18:59: I think ima go digital dont trust my kids they will prolly think the disk are freesbies  how ever u spell it hahaha

2020-09-16 22:20:08: Is nobody talking about that CoD trailer where the dude didn't even actually take aim when he sniped the target? Legit barely went to aim down sights and instantly took the shot.

2020-09-16 22:20:33: The PlayStation Plus Collection is already worth getting a PS5 at launch since I havent played a lot of those games. Too bad I dont have wifi to download them lol.
2020-09-16 22:20:42: Battlefield 1 is gonna be lit on ps5

2020-09-16 22:22:25: Why is the Demon's Souls video removed from Playstation's official YouTube channel? It was there following the reveal, in 4K 60fps. It's also gone from my watch history.

2020-09-16 22:23:39: Por 500 dolares una ps5? una consola de menor potencia!Esta vez me ire a XBOX porque siento que PS  me van a estafar. Esperaba un precio mas economico que la xbox  unica razon para mantenerme en PS.
2020-09-16 22:24:37: > Ragnarok is coming...
2020-09-16 22:23:55: I was here... lol 
2020-09-16 22:23:56: Video starts at 59:19
2020-09-16 22:24:13: 1:41:23 Does this mean we have to have PS Plus just to play PS4 games? I thought all our PS4 discs were going to work.
2020-09-16 22:24:53: ALL THE DISLIKES ARE FROM XBOX FANS
2020-09-16 23:01:46: > pc guys

2020-09-16 22:25:42: what happened to the special invites only for ps5 like sony promised?  also the WELL IN ADVANCE lead time they swore up and down they'd give us a heads up weeks before starting preorders?
2020-09-16 22:25:45: The only thing I ask is whats the FPS
2020-09-16 22:25:48: For $ 500 a ps5? a lower power console! This time I'm going to XBOX because I feel like PS I'm going to rip off. I was expecting a cheaper price than the xbox  the only reason to stay on PS.
2020-09-16 22:35:00: > buy digital version
2020-09-16 22:26:00: Masakra:)
2020-09-16 22:26:06: Slightly off topic, but the music they played before the presentation, what is it from? Was it from their games?

2020-09-16 22:28:16: hi im a old comment we are in 2020 thats for 2025 or 2024 or 2023 or 2022
2020-09-16 22:28:21: 21:13 just vindicated why I went and got a Ps4  as a Xbox owner also I kinda feel bad for em
2020-09-16 22:28:22: FNAF IS COMING TO PS5?!
2020-09-16 22:28:25: Yeppppp.. Its Xbox for me. It was fun Sony
2020-09-16 22:28:27: Where's gta??
2020-09-16 22:28:27: I was here the day they announced the price and release date
2020-09-16 22:28:37: Sony and the legend of the $100 disk drive...
2020-09-16 22:28:51: just leaving a mark for when the future comes
2020-09-16 22:28:58: Hogwarts legacy
2020-09-16 22:29:05: Edit: it was removed so ignore this comment
2020-09-16 22:29:42: Will the PS5 be backwards compatible with like PS2 or PS3 discs?
2020-09-16 22:29:50: > no
2020-09-16 22:40:17: > @Yellow Devil are you sure, 'cause i really thought it would have backwards compatibility
2020-09-16 22:40:56: > I've seen that some PS4 games will be supported on the PS5 and will get an update, not sure though
2020-09-16 22:42:12: > @Killian Gaming some ps4 games at launch, more will be added later. nothing else is official. so no ps2+ps3.
2020-09-16 22:43:38: > @PutoJooj yeah they announced that they were gonna remaster some PS4 games but i wonder if we MIGHT finally have backwards compatibility on a PlayStation system
2020-09-16 23:54:44: > @Killian Gaming ps vita to psp XD
2020-09-16 22:29:45: You wronged @smiles2003nc. @playstation
2020-09-16 22:29:58: > Playstation
2020-09-16 22:30:10: > PlayStation
2020-09-16 22:29:57: Preordering that digital edition tomorrow! Lets go, November 12th!!!
2020-09-17 02:28:59: > Don't pre order digital edition do the disc edition
2020-09-17 02:42:37: > What is the difference between digital and not?
2020-09-17 02:45:21: > @Seanthevlogger 1  F they lied to us
2020-09-17 02:53:00: > Epic 1 One can use physical discs the other is only digital. The specs are exactly the same. Getting the digital version, you save yourself that extra $100+ to use on games. I was getting tired of changing out my games every time I wanted to play something different. No worries with the digital.
2020-09-17 02:53:25: > F's in the chat
2020-09-17 03:28:24: > Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and also new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-17 03:36:49: > Only fools buy digital games. Youre getting scammed. Do NOT buy digital games.
2020-09-17 04:05:09: > Gary Oak Yeah. Were getting scammed. 
2020-09-17 04:16:47: > Subtle Beast yes, you are. Thats what I said. Only a moron would pay the same price for something that has half the cost. Hence the scam. Digital games are for suckers, and PS and Microsoft are taking full advantage of those suckers. And not only had half the cost, but is something that has zero value once youve bought it. Its ones and zeros on a drive. A physical game has value. Both short term and long.
2020-09-17 05:58:37: > Gary Oak Lol. Okay, bud. Keep going physical. I really dont care. Nobody scamming anybody with digital. I dont play games that are years old. Never have, never will. When new systems come out, I never even touch my old system because its gone as a trade-in. Go to your local GameStop and see how much value your physical games have.
2020-09-17 07:30:04: > Subtle Beast you clearly dont understand anything I just said.
2020-09-17 07:30:44: > Gary Oak Yeah... clearly. 
2020-09-16 22:30:03: bom gostei bastante só n entendi mt porque que o fnaf ta em 3D se puder explica ow dono da playstation se voce puder explica tamo bem blz? é nois man fica bem ai curto teu trampo

2020-09-16 22:30:54: > Whens the release date?
2020-09-16 22:31:55: > @Zeke_ShıKari 123 November 19. But honestly. I'm just happy I've managed to order it already. Instead of waiting until tomorrow or seeing it sold out already
2020-09-16 22:32:30: > Im happy for u, thx btw 
2020-09-16 22:42:06: > @Zeke_ShıKari 123 Thank you ️
2020-09-16 22:50:33: > Ur welcome, do u mind me asking, what games are u gonna play
2020-09-16 22:30:28: See you guys in 7 years when this is recommended to everyone close to the PS6 launch. The PS5 is going to be amazing
2020-09-16 22:30:29: So glad I watched the VOD and skipped through most of that.
2020-09-16 22:30:33: I was gonna buy gaming pc but now PS5 Let's Gooooo
2020-09-17 01:38:11: > Ps5 for the price of a graphics card. Sold . I was thinking the same but might as well wait till mid cycle on the PS5 to grab one now.
2020-09-16 22:30:35: Poor xbox
2020-09-16 22:30:36: So is Demons Souls coming to PC too then? Also a 'limited time' PS5 exclusive.. so it's going to come to other consoles later on too?  If it is coming to PC aswell, I'm tempted to put off buying a PS5 for a while, will wait for the price to go down and just play Demons Souls on pc.
2020-09-16 22:40:55: > where does it say timed exclusive? source?
2020-09-16 22:45:26: > @Yellow Devil Underneath where it says Demons Souls PS5 exclusive.  In small print below it says..  'Not available on other consoles for a limited time. Also available on PC.  I'm guessing it won't be available on PC either for a limited time.. but they worded it wrong.
2020-09-16 22:50:06: > @B arkermush i watch the video and didnt even see that. only on the ff16 trailer. hm...
2020-09-16 22:30:48: BORING
2020-09-16 22:34:04: > For you
2020-09-16 22:31:02: PS5 exclusive, also avaiable on PC ;D
2020-09-17 02:53:07: > Xbox game pass for Pc
2020-09-16 22:31:11: Es 8ncreible esta maquina
2020-09-16 22:31:14: Still no Gravity Rush 3, but Final Fantasy XVI was a great surprise (for someone who didn't like FFVII Remake). Definitely going to take Demon's Souls too.

2020-09-16 22:32:02: I'm not buying one anytime soon. Sony is yet to show that PSPlus is anything but a scam
2020-09-16 22:32:06: Qual a razão de deixar 60 min de introdução?
2020-09-16 22:32:26: We need a new fight night boxing game!!!
2020-09-16 22:32:30: I want it so much, but I have no money, I only have a Playstation 1 and 2, I would love a Playstation 5 or a Playstation 4. SONY, would you like to give one as a gift?  A donation to a Playstation fan since the 90s.
2020-09-16 22:32:42: Eh, I miss soo much those old-school Final Fantasy'ies. square-enix - what have you done?! :(

2020-09-16 22:33:18: Sony take ur time making this awesome games we don't need all of them to be a launch title don't rush
2020-09-16 22:33:25: Surprised not everyone is talking about console wars maybe a few but mostly no one also who is getting both consoles?

2020-09-16 22:33:51: I'm so anxious
2020-09-16 22:33:54: $399? I really thought it would be in the $429-449 price range but for anyone that doesn't care about 4K, a $299 PS5 mini would break Microsoft... hahahaha...
2020-09-16 22:33:59: 59:23 this where it actually begins
2020-09-16 22:34:03: *Hears Kratos' beautiful voice*: B O Y FLASHBACKS INTENSIFY

2020-09-16 22:36:18: > miles looks like cross-gen that simply skips ps4.

2020-09-17 03:32:41: > Also no PS5 exclusives, FF16 and Harry Potter coming to PC   New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and also new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*

2020-09-16 22:44:11: I just wish that there was gonna be a new killzone game
2020-09-16 23:56:25: > Horizon is the new main series from the studio so no time for Killzone 
2020-09-17 00:13:36: > Killzone reboot apparently in the works but won't come until after Horizon 2. I'm guessing it will be one of the final games of this new generation.
2020-09-17 00:54:09: > They are busy with horizon 2, btw we got many generic shooter game now
2020-09-17 01:06:14: > @Raiden Kalisz I was about to say that, we have enough shooters. Killzone has 6 games, let them flesh out Horizon and get a Vita to get more Killzone.
2020-09-17 01:33:40: > Same.
2020-09-17 04:27:09: > Guerilla is indeed working on a new FPS IP. Maybe it will be inspired by Killzone. I guess its too early in development to announce that
2020-09-16 22:44:24: Where's granturismo 7?

2020-09-16 22:45:48: So this PlayStation plus collection thing. Do you have to have it to play ps4 games on the ps5 if you already own the game?
2020-09-16 22:47:50: > no. its just for people who buy the digital edition and people who skipped ps4 generation. you can put your bloodborne disc in day 1 too.
2020-09-16 23:06:36: > Yellow Devil The question is do Persona 5 and Bloodborne run at 60fps
2020-09-16 23:49:29: > @SoulsFanatic 2020 thats indeed the question. if its just 1080p with better loadtimes... yeah i would skip bloodborne if thats the case. im coming over after 16 years on xbox and i hope to avoid the technical issues from the ps4 version of bloodborne.
2020-09-17 00:13:35: > Yellow Devil Even with the technical issues Bloodborne is amazing but yeah if its not 60fps Then Ill just stick with my PS4 version.
2020-09-17 01:36:52: > @SoulsFanatic 2020 they just announced that spider-man, horizon 2 and other "ps5" games are coming to ps4! sony lied again by saying they dont do cross-gen unlike xbox and only bring them to ps5 -_-
2020-09-17 02:03:38: > Yellow Devil Wait so its just a graphics upgrade in that case Im sticking with my PS4 because if I can play demon souls on PS4 thats great  dont care about graphics upgrades
2020-09-16 22:45:56: Price is kind of disappointing not gonna lie.

2020-09-16 22:50:30: I cannot wait until I get my hands on one of these!!! I can afford $399
2020-09-17 01:07:59: > Just curious, why would you get the one that can't use discs over the one that can? I just think it's best to get the one with the most features.  Edited this comment because I think the original wording got taken the wrong way.
2020-09-17 01:13:13: > @dapperfan44 i think its because he buy digital games only
2020-09-17 01:19:32: > @dapperfan44 it's not inferior, just different
2020-09-17 01:28:53: > @dapperfan44 inferior? Not everyone needs disc drive
2020-09-17 01:29:49: > @laws of earth I mean, one can play discs and the other can't. By definition that means it's the inferior version. Much like the PS4 is inferior to PS4 Pro. And maybe not everyone needs it, but you lose a lot without one.
2020-09-17 02:10:22: > Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-17 03:26:52: > @dapperfan44 You don't lose nothing since this is not 1999. Who still uses discs?
2020-09-17 03:27:31: > Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and also new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-17 03:34:14: > @Bruce Rogers Ummm ppl who want to play their PS4 games maybe? People who wanna rent 4K movies and watch them on their PS5 maybe? Ppl who have old memories that are stored on a CD? Think, dude. It's not that hard.
2020-09-17 03:39:13: > dapperfan44 If game sharing is still a thing on the PS5 then buying digitally is actually a lot cheaper for households with multiple consoles. (Buy the game once and u get it on both consoles). Thats also not to mention the obvious fact the digital edition console it self is a lot cheaper.
2020-09-17 03:49:29: > @Bruce Rogers I asked a simple question, what's up with all the condescension? And what do you mean it's not 1999? People didn't start downloading games until the early 10s. We mostly still used CDs until then. The Blu-Ray DISC format alone was one of Sony's biggest selling points for PS3.   If you don't have a disc drive you can't watch your blu ray discs, you can't play your DVDs, and people can't bring games over to your house because you don't have a disc drive. It'll be a lot harder to borrow games from a friend, and you won't be able to use any of your old PS4 discs either. Like I said, you're losing a lot. Plus, some people simply like to collect physical things. There's nothing wrong with that.  Plus, you can't download games on to the PlayStation 2, GameCube, or Xbox. All of which came out after 1999.
2020-09-17 03:57:17: > Also, people, a little something called "de-listing" is a thing. Games get de-listed from the store all the time. Big games. If you don't buy it and the publisher decides to remove the game, you can't play it. For example, right now you can only play Transformers games and the Deadpool game if you get the disc version because you can no longer buy them in the store. Whether or not you're actually interested in these games isn't my point, my point is that de-listing can happen to any game at any time and if you don't get something before that happens, then you just miss out. If you don't have a disc drive on your console, you'll never get to play that de-listed game (legally).
2020-09-17 04:08:38: > @dapperfan44 if he doesn't play disc's he's gaining money not losing anything
2020-09-17 04:11:59: > @TMeek94 I listed a few things that get lost without a disc drive in earlier comments, including when games get de-listed.
2020-09-17 04:12:25: > @Mikael Who rents movies in 2020? Are you joking? You must be.
2020-09-17 04:15:45: > @Mikael ummm you don't need ps4 discs to play ps4 games on ps5 just saying....
2020-09-17 04:17:39: > @laws of earth The point is that the option to use a PS4 disc is there with a disc drive. Otherwise you can only play the games you bought digitally.
2020-09-17 04:25:41: > @Bruce Rogers Imagine using discs in 2020 lol.
2020-09-17 04:29:28: > @Santhosh Manickavasagam Some people have to. It may not be your situation or mine, but some people live in areas where there's only one internet provider and it's incredibly expensive, or they get hardly any internet at all. Those people have to get discs.
2020-09-17 05:00:30: > @dapperfan44 yea the things you listed were pretty stupid and don't matter to what I said
2020-09-17 05:02:04: > $499
2020-09-17 05:44:27: > @UC9Cw-8-sisBdWNuvItveF_A nah the point about not being able to use the disc tray was really stupid, he is obviously aware of that, he will most likely still have his ps4 so guess what he can still enjoy blu ray and ps4 discs And then ironic you bring up it just being an opinion, when here you are trying to change this guys opinion on getting the digital one
2020-09-17 05:49:37: > @TMeek94 I asked him a question, I wasn't trying to change his opinion nor did I call his post stupid. I didn't insult anyone here and your stupid comment was, well, stupid and uncalled for. And yes, I still have my PS4. No, I don't want to continue to use my PS4 if I'm getting enhancements on PS5 instead. Its not stupid, period. Its stupid to you because you don't value physical media, but that doesn't make it stupid to everyone. The point is one console will let you get everything in one without going back and forth between two consoles. If you want to do that, then that's you.
2020-09-17 05:54:40: > @dapperfan44 ah see another stupid statement! I love my physical media, so don't be ignorant, clearly this guy doesn't, so why don't you f off and let him save 100 bucks?
2020-09-17 06:00:00: > @TMeek94 Again, all I did was ask a simple question. No insults or anything. That's it. He has not yet responded, that's his prerogative. I responded, respectfully might I add, to everyone else's response. I responded respectfully to you too, until you indirectly called me stupid. Now, again, I dont know why you got so offended but its not necessary. Just admit that you were in the wrong, or at the very least bring it down a notch and start being civil.  And if you truly loved your physical media, you wouldn't have dismissed all of the points I made as they were all valid, especially the one about games you can't buy from the store anymore.  From here on out, let's just squash all of that and have a civil discussion, which was my original intention. I just wanted to talk about the differences between the two consoles, it wasn't supposed to blow up into this. --- Now that I think of it, buying the digital version would also be the loss of being able to easily swap games. Me personally, if I purchase something (that is if I paid for it outright, PS+ games don't count) I don't want to have to download it again. I want it to stay on the system indefinitely. Eventually the drive gets full. Especially now, games are incredibly large and take up 40-70 gigs on a 1TB drive.   With a disc drive, if I need the space I can just delete the game install. Then when I want to play it again, I just install it again. I don't have to wait for a download to complete yet again just for a game that was once deleted.
2020-09-17 14:59:06: > @TMeek94 You must've been a real loser in debate in high school, with all of your contradicting.
2020-09-24 06:29:55: > @Mikael yeah don't mind him. Let him have $70 games for life.
2020-09-16 22:50:30: Hmm,  PS4: $399 PS5: $499  Seems to be a pattern so, lets predict future PlayStation Console prices, because why not?!  PS6: $599 PS7: $699 PS8: $799 PS9: $899 PS10: $999 PS11: $1099 PS12: $1199  That was fun!  Sony, Ive priced your future consoles for you, youre welcome!
2020-09-16 22:50:47: i am a big harry potter fan so um yesh
2020-09-16 22:51:35: People hating on FNAF only for being a FNAF game ,_,
2020-09-16 22:51:37: I really hope the eventual Slim-version will look a lot better than those horrible looking monstrosities.
2020-09-16 22:52:03: 100 bucks for the CD reader, really?
2020-09-16 23:34:34: > You mean DVD... cd is so old school ️ im just teasing ya lol   Im still thinking which one to get though, digital or with the disc drive
2020-09-16 23:36:44: > 4K hd bluray!! Check the price of a decent 4K player. Usually $200+ as a big gamer and movie collector I'm stoked.
2020-09-16 22:52:20: Xbox  Just do better
2020-09-16 22:52:21: it.s Great

2020-09-16 22:53:15: I need the music for the waiting screen, like, yesterday.  I need all of it.
2020-09-16 22:53:34: Me not hearing anything about digital ps4 games retrocompatibility: "Ok i think im not gonna buy this console"
2020-09-16 23:19:13: > but they are retrocompatible
2020-09-16 23:43:59: > @Juanxtreme CF i heard the same thing when the ps4 came out and i have to bought some of my previous games on the ps4. I just see a collection of psplus in ps5 that just come with games that i already bought, some that the psplus that already gave me and the others that i dont really interested. But what about my library of my ps4 games (if i buy a ps5) at least the full games (that i already bought will be in the ps5?
2020-09-16 23:54:33: > @mario lopez they mentioned it earlier this year that it will be backwards compatible with ps4, so I guess it will work
2020-09-16 22:53:54: Sony secured a fat W today
2020-09-16 22:54:00: They copied Xbox
2020-09-16 23:41:30: > How
2020-09-16 22:54:14: Wow 
2020-09-16 22:54:34: PS5 pre-order is going to be a battle royale at the stores.
2020-09-16 22:55:10: 59:15 - Start 1:00:34 - Final Fantasy XVI  1:05:03 - Spider Miles Morales  1:12:27 - Hogwarts Legacy  1:15:19 - Call Of Duty Black Ops Cold War  1:21:18 - Village  1:23:54 - Death loop  1:27:57 - Devil May Cry 5 Special Edition  1:30:15 - Oddworld Soul storm  1:32:39 - Five Nights At Freddy's Security Breach  1:34:06 - Demon's Souls  1:38:39 - Fortnite  1:39:14 - PlayStation Plus  1:42:35 - Price  1:42:43 - Global Launch  1:43:38 - Ragnarok
2020-09-16 22:55:39: So I'm guessing if I want to play my disc based copies of the PS4 games that I own, rather than being able to play them right away on the PS5, I would need to get a PSN subscription in order to play them? 
2020-09-17 03:46:07: > Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and also new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-16 22:55:45: Final Fantasy Lit

2020-09-16 22:55:54: no ray tracing = fail. ps5 will last at 5 years minimum, rtx 3090 are on the way, DDR5 ram too, new processors are to be announced... this "next gen" console is already obsolete... it's nice to have new audio engine but the headset are not inluded with the console... most people have a regular 2.0 audio headset so they will never hear the difference. And all those trailers are from a PC...
2020-09-16 22:56:19: All that talk for this trash im leaving this garbage behind im moving to xbox 
2020-09-16 22:56:20: Final Fantasy XVI is a PS5 exclusive AND Sony announced Ragnarok ooohhh wooow RIP Xbox you sir are DEFINITELY done!!
2020-09-16 23:00:31: > What a dumb fanboy. So easily duped. Its a timed exclusive, plus gow is not a shocking reveal. Just stop.
2020-09-16 22:56:26: PlayStation I love you, I really truly do but uploading a whole hr of blue screen 
2020-09-16 22:56:50: Please like this so future me can see it when this video is recommended again in like 5 or 6 years
2020-09-16 22:57:07: they should do like more anime games
2020-09-16 22:57:09: "So now you know....so stop asking"
2020-09-17 01:59:08: > The only question I have is does that mean this year 2020 or 2021
2020-09-17 02:09:34: > So can you play PS3 games on it?  You know I had to ask one more question.
2020-09-17 02:55:40: > Nick Loos this year bro

2020-09-16 23:38:12: > BROO ME TOO
2020-09-16 22:57:30: Bro why do I have to pay another hundred dollars just so I can have a disc reader?
2020-09-16 23:39:41: > Disc are cheaper
2020-09-17 03:02:44: > electric pug how
2020-09-16 22:57:38: 59:22  everything before that is the staging screen.
2020-09-16 22:58:14: It begins at 59:16
2020-09-16 22:58:16: When you're here, after 15 years, still waiting for Legend of Dragoon Remake and Sony drops Final Fantasy 16 in their show...am i joke to you?
2020-09-16 23:03:26: > I really hope they don't remake The Legend Of Dragoon. Just leave it as it is, Its perfect on the PS1.
2020-09-16 23:42:47: > @ThePsOne It is in fact perfect on the PS1, but that gem deserves recognition. It deserves a proper remake where it can show itself in full glory on a proper machine like PS5. Showin what the devs original vision and ambition actually were. Because we all know PS1 highly limited the ambition and vision of games back then (as any other machine obviously).
2020-09-16 22:58:20: at the very end of the showcase, is a fragment of a space alien shooter game, any idea what game it is? timestamp: 1:45:26
2020-09-16 23:39:08: > Dunno what's its called, it's about a lady that does on a planet and when she wakes up he planet is different
2020-09-16 23:40:54: > @electric pug ok thought it was another game, like starfield
2020-09-16 22:58:21: Can someone lend me $496 I just need to borrow it
2020-09-16 22:58:28: Looks like Sony is relying more on their Developers to make exclusives than the performance of the machine... Also Black ops looks horrible...
2020-09-16 23:38:14: > Not horrible just not next gen
2020-09-16 22:58:57: Demon's Souls and Spider Man as launch games, thats a huge win over Xbox, amazing stuff. That Demon's Souls gameplay looked absolutly stunning, only thing weird was the hiting with the sword animation it lacked a little weight maybe?
2020-09-16 22:58:58: What exactly does it mean by digital? Sorry I am new to gaming
2020-09-16 23:03:01: > It means that you have to buy the games digitally instead of on discs.
2020-09-16 23:37:45: > No disc
2020-09-16 23:39:15: > Are the graphics better or something
2020-09-16 22:59:08: Starts at 59:18

2020-09-16 23:37:34: > No

2020-09-16 23:00:58: Does anyone know how long will we have to wait for those who aren't going to preorder?

2020-09-16 23:01:56: Xbox series x is clearly the way to go     I lied.
2020-09-16 23:02:05: I don't like how they  got  rid of the colors on the PS Controller buttons  
2020-09-16 23:37:14: > I do
2020-09-16 23:02:16: yo solo tengo la ps3 :(
2020-09-16 23:02:29: Is this in canadian dollars or usd?
2020-09-16 23:37:07: > Usd
2020-09-16 23:02:44: Im hoping we get miles's suit from "Into The Spider-verse"
2020-09-16 23:37:02: > Definitely
2020-09-16 23:41:55: > Most likely considering that Insomniac pulled through with the suits we wanted in the original.
2020-09-16 23:57:40: > With or without the hoodie, though?
2020-09-17 03:30:00: > Just buy it for the PS4, not a PS5 exclusive
2020-09-17 03:58:00: > @FL33T WOOD  Doesn't matter you get 4k60 on PS5 and many more games coming
2020-09-17 04:05:45: > @D3_3C_IchsanElzharRafi PS5 can't do 4K 60fps on SpiderMan Miles Morales *without a downgrade-visually "performance mode."*  And that's a last gen game......
2020-09-17 04:27:32: > @FL33T WOOD Doesn't matter it's still 4k60 the visual change is probably very very minor.  Depends on the games, most PS games are very demanding with high polygons, detailed environment, huge npc, detailed characters , great visual effects, great environment shadow, etc. and they added Ray tracing as well.  Unlike xbox,most Xbox games are simple and nowhere near the quality of PS games. Just look at sea of thieves and new Halo even crackdown ran at 30fps.  Last time I checked the only game they push to match PS games is quantum break but, the games breaks a lot  even runs horrible on one x.
2020-09-17 04:47:04: > @FL33T WOOD I think miles is exclusive to ps5
2020-09-17 12:23:45: > @D3_3C_IchsanElzharRafi I play on PC...  Actually the PS5 has a visual downgrade "performance" mode for Rachet & Clank, same with Spiderman: Miles Morales, meaning it can't handle the visuals at 4k/60fps......  That's adding to the fact that Spider Miles Morales is a "current" gen game as well.
2020-09-16 23:03:21: Harry Potter Game Makes me buy the PS5  I AM READY FOR THAAAAAATT DAMMNNNB

2020-09-19 23:32:21: > @Aoi Zen Copying directly from Sony's blogpost which they clearly didn't want to announce at the PS5 event for millions to know.  I'm literally helping spread the news. Why does that bother you? 
2020-09-20 00:32:03: > @FL33T WOOD u can comment what ever u want here...link please
2020-09-20 00:52:41: > @Aoi Zen Comment what? Link what? PS4 versions also coming? It's on their blogpost...
2020-09-16 23:03:32: Guys have you seen the prices for a games in Europe? We have to boycot them ASAP, that's ridiculous 80 for a game?! 4 games cost almost same as Digital version of PS5. I was pumped myself for release but sorry Sony I have to cancel my preorder for now as I don't need dust collecting device for 500. The exchange rates as of today are 69,99$ is 59,25 in Nederland and that is a scandal asking for a game 80!  Boycot, boycot boycot

2020-09-16 23:08:40: Soooooo....we all got the statement why Playstation is gonna stay the best console brand in history of gaming. Thank you kindly, Sony. I love you.
2020-09-16 23:08:50: 1:32:39 the hype train is going full speed , I'm gonna preorder it when preorders start.
2020-09-16 23:08:55: Ight...I'm speechless that's all I'm going to say...
2020-09-16 23:09:38: Starts at 59:15
2020-09-16 23:09:42: ليه مافيه عربي
2020-09-16 23:09:50: Yo why TF does it start a hour in.
2020-09-16 23:09:59: Sorry xbox Sony is doing it all over again
2020-09-16 23:10:15: Man, i know OG Spider-Man fans are gonna hate this, but Miles has to be the most powerful version outside of 2099. He just has so many abilities beside super-strength.
2020-09-16 23:10:17: Spider man is going to be so lit
2020-09-16 23:10:35: demons souls gang 1:34:07
2020-09-17 03:27:08: > Yeahhhhh
2020-09-17 03:28:30: > But demon souls remake doesn't have the same atmosphere as original demon souls which is a down point
2020-09-17 15:35:05: > @Mary P.V. yep thats true

2020-09-16 23:11:05: Amazing
2020-09-16 23:11:09: Soooooo... sony made that move again huh. 399 for digital edition that is technically the same specs with the disc drive version. Still undecided if Im buying this version or will wait for the v2 ps5 as Ive always been doing.   I was swayed by the xbox series s price but this effectively cemented my decision, ps5 is where the games i want to play is.
2020-09-16 23:11:10: *$499 *  *4,999 *
2020-09-16 23:34:51: > No way
2020-09-16 23:11:24: 
2020-09-16 23:12:21: Why is this age restricted

2020-09-16 23:13:05: THIS is the future of gaming...
2020-09-17 03:43:21: > FF16  & Harry Potter coming to PC!  Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and also new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-16 23:13:22: 1:16:20 is this called next gen graphics by treyarch ? Hahahahahahahaaha This is soooo 2015 !
2020-09-16 23:34:35: > Yeah I got to agree only the people look more realistic
2020-09-16 23:13:33: When I saw the Demon Souls gameplay : 
2020-09-17 04:39:01: > SHUT UP AND GET A MONEY!
2020-09-17 05:12:03: > @aitareya Dwibedi 1 dollar~410 tenge
2020-09-17 06:39:49: > Looks like a cartoon version of Demon Souls tbh. Definitely not what i expected and From Soft didnt help with the face lift which tells me they probably didnt approve. They made Dark Souls specifically because Sony owned the rights to Demons Souls.
2020-09-16 23:13:46: Still waiting for silent hill
2020-09-16 23:14:12: This looks amazing, may I ask though, will the console come in its classic black?
2020-09-17 01:39:59: > Yes we need a black one!
2020-09-17 03:25:25: > _ TheNamelessGamer _ dbrand it !
2020-09-17 03:37:21: > The one in the thumbnail is black, dude.
2020-09-17 03:43:10: > Gary Oak definitely not black, unless you have a different thumbnail. Just looks like a white console under dim lighting. Pre orders are open and all while consoles
2020-09-17 04:03:47: > Alex1911 huh. Looks black on my screen.
2020-09-17 04:12:22: > Gary Oak its white but the way they did some of the transitions caused the console to look almost black for a split second
2020-09-17 04:19:02: > Gary Oak, pre orders gone already anyways . Maybe there will be a black one eventually
2020-09-17 04:21:10: > Alex1911 I only want a white one. I wanted a white ps4 and got stuck with a black one because I bought it so long after it came out. I had the 1, 2, and 3, at launch. But 5 is looking like its gonna follow the path of 4. I have no interest in any of the games that have been announced. I was hoping to see a new resistance fall of man game.
2020-09-17 04:24:26: > Gary Oak I just want black ops Cold War zombies and I can do that on my PS4. Till then Im on my PS3 playing BO2 zombies 
2020-09-17 05:25:35: > Not at launch but they'll probably release other special colors later after it's been on the market for a few months.  There's going to be all kinds of special editions.
2020-09-17 05:52:45: > The classic is gray.
2020-09-17 06:18:18: > @ghostshadow I'm hoping they do a cyberpunk edition!!!
2020-09-17 15:49:10: > @Bo Li That would be so awesome!
2020-09-16 23:14:18: Man I wish they remaster FALLOUT NV OR FALLOUT 3
2020-09-16 23:14:20: I like the concept of DeathLoop
2020-09-16 23:14:22: aw nice
2020-09-16 23:14:25: $1099. Umm that came in higher than expected.
2020-09-16 23:34:08: > What?
2020-09-17 02:19:28: > @electric pug I know right?
2020-09-17 04:47:19: > @mrfld it's 500 dollars my guy
2020-09-17 13:27:01: > Yeah the Xbox is cheap.
2020-09-17 14:10:32: > @mrfld no the ps5 is 500
2020-09-17 18:30:00: > @electric pug 
2020-09-17 18:38:01: > @mrfld what?
2020-09-18 02:49:16: > @electric pug exactly bruh!
2020-09-18 03:24:46: > @mrfld the ps5 is 500 dollars not 1000
2020-09-16 23:14:32: Who would wanna buy a consol that looks like an analog radios speakers or better yet a talkie walkie? Xbox have checked out years ago. Only dumb fans would say its better than the PS5.
2020-09-16 23:14:32: RAGNAROK IS COMINGGG!!!!!
2020-09-17 03:29:12: > To the PS4

2020-09-16 23:18:49: Sorry xbox it was fun all these years but IM MOVING TO PS5 BYE!
2020-09-16 23:52:20: > Haha playstation gang
2020-09-16 23:18:54: Meh I think I got myself physced up to much for, "next gen"... looks the same and the games were kinda dull. I like the price though. I was hoping for much more from the PS Plus... that was a huge let down. But obviously I'm still buying.  I'll probably go with Xbox X with the monthly payment option and their amazing Game Pass and get PS5 Digital edition. That way all my bases are covered.
2020-09-16 23:20:20: > Miles morales was next-gen Not dull but your it's your money
2020-09-17 00:26:24: > @Myntrix miles looks cross-gen with hdr colors. at least on my 4k tv.... than again... it was a 1080p stream... thats probably why. details get lost.
2020-09-16 23:19:10: How bad i crave for the " SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY" meme.....

2020-09-16 23:20:13: Gran Turismo 7
2020-09-16 23:20:27: back after securing a pre order
2020-09-16 23:21:14: I want at least 90% of these games and more from PS5, cant wait for this new generation.
2020-09-17 02:09:53: > Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-17 04:49:56: > FL33T WOOD Who cares? Lol Xbox is doing the same thing too. Still getting PS5 for ray tracing and 4k
2020-09-17 04:56:26: > @Angel Gutierrez what about 3090 with 8k lol costs more then 2 ps5
2020-09-17 05:02:12: > Rohit Chawda It costs over 1000 dollars for a single graphics card, with PS5 you get a whole system for 500 dollars. Better deal imo.
2020-09-17 06:00:14: > @Angel Gutierrez Don't expect the same performance tho.
2020-09-17 06:05:09: > Angel Gutierrez true, console is there for best price to performance. PC is there for best performance and customization
2020-09-17 06:06:00: > what's the 10% you won't buy lol
2020-09-17 12:30:16: > @Angel Gutierrez Yea but Sony never told the whole truth.....they held back information until the pre-orders.
2020-09-16 23:21:26: WHAT
2020-09-16 23:21:36: Pure fire !
2020-09-16 23:21:39: Yaaaaaaassss I love playstation

2020-09-16 23:23:38: Can u pls give cjdaboss-_- his account back
2020-09-17 00:21:37: > no. he deserved it
2020-09-16 23:23:57: Where the !@#$ is the compatibility for Horizon: Zero Dawn and Ghost of Tsushima?  Microsoft is not the only ones that disappoint.  Oh wait, we can't use the PS4 controller because of Sony incompetence acting with bad faith against players.  I do not need the PS5 "features" to play the PS4 games I want with the "features" that PS4 provided.  You are just making excuses to force consumers to buy a PS5.  Liars to the bone, just like Microsoft.
2020-09-16 23:23:58: F XBOX
2020-09-16 23:24:06: i watched it, not gonna lie
2020-09-16 23:24:12: 7100 downvoting Xbox fanboy cries salty tears, because Microsoft is already soooooo behind in this race, that it cannot even be called one
2020-09-17 00:20:56: > you make us playstation gamers look bad with your toxic comments.
2020-09-16 23:24:14: Starts 59:20
2020-09-16 23:29:15: > Thank you kind sir
2020-09-16 23:24:23: Psvr is death?
2020-09-16 23:24:58: They presented Ragnarok at the end like if it was a big deal, what all true fans of play station want is SILENT HILL, those who have been with this company since PS1 its what we are expecting.  SOrry, NO SILENT HILL, NO PS5 for me,,
2020-09-16 23:25:04: Already pre-ordered (in germany)
2020-09-17 00:45:41: > already pre-ordered (in Algeria)
2020-09-16 23:25:30: Final Fantasy I love it.
2020-09-16 23:25:42: Hmm... The demon Souls remake looks off :/
2020-09-16 23:31:44: > How
2020-09-16 23:43:26: > @electric pug I'm not entirely sure how to put it in words but I'll give it my best. It doesn't look like a From game (which it admittedly isn't). It looks more like a game that wants to be a From game. From the animation work to the camera placement itself it's all a little off. It feels different if that makes sense. I'm not doubting that it's gonna be great, I'm just saying that it doesn't quite nail the From style which is more a complement to From than it is a criticism to Bluepoint. Bluepoint did great in the past I doubt they'll disappoint here.
2020-09-16 23:53:28: > @TheFadingOne alright
2020-09-16 23:26:13: Is it just me ffxvi looks potato than ffxv....
2020-09-16 23:26:17: Please don't make the PS4 collection digital only. Not all of us can afford high speed internet and unlimited data caps.
2020-09-16 23:26:21: The following content was captured on pc.
2020-09-16 23:31:31: > Only final fantasy

2020-09-16 23:26:55: where gta 5 remastered???
2020-09-16 23:26:59: 500?... Ill see you when you release the (cheaper and more efficient) slim version :D
2020-09-16 23:31:18: > That would look weird now that I think about it
2020-09-16 23:27:22: BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
2020-09-16 23:27:31: 59:26 starts here
2020-09-16 23:28:36: > Thank you
2020-09-17 00:19:23: > the video isnt even 48 minutes long
2020-09-16 23:27:39: That Final Fantasy is basically Fire Force
2020-09-16 23:27:42: How many lost their minds when seeing the release date!?! Maybe we can now look for gta 6!!
2020-09-17 03:36:19: > FF16  & Harry Potter coming to PC!  Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and also new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-16 23:27:52: There is Not a single Game i would buy
2020-09-16 23:30:52: > Weirdo
2020-09-16 23:28:07: Boring show. Most of these wont  be ready for another 3yrs at least. Not worth investing in this for me.
2020-09-16 23:30:35: > Didn't know 2021 was in 3 years
2020-09-16 23:31:38: > @electric pug you believe that bs that gow will actually be ready next year.
2020-09-16 23:54:11: > @AZ brown_knight no, and I could care less about gow
2020-09-16 23:28:25: That Harry Potter game actually looks awesome
2020-09-17 00:13:34: > I absolutely hate Harry Potter. Seriously, I hate the books, the movies and the games but this one has my attention. Its giving me some major "fable on another level" vibes. I may actually try this one out.
2020-09-17 01:05:13: > Yup, thought it wasnt looking as childish as in the movies actually. Visually beautiful, thought FF was a bit of a let down, but hopefully it looks better on PS 5 than on this PC demonstration.
2020-09-17 01:16:29: > It looks like a Skyrim-ish game, definitely interested.
2020-09-17 01:16:46: > My recommendation is don't pre-order it.
2020-09-17 01:28:22: > We've been asking for this for so long!! Ever since Hogwarts mystery!! I'm so excited!!
2020-09-17 01:34:12: > @urbanshadow777 at least learn up on the terminology and other concepts of the wizerding world otherwise its all going to go over your head
2020-09-17 01:45:18: > @Manuel Medellin It will probably be the same graphics especially now rtx 3000 has came out with better tech
2020-09-17 01:56:07: > @Luke Cheung Yup, physical version will prolly drop to 399 $ in late 2021, when they announce the better performing PRO version. Then you are in a dilemma as you already aquired the inferior version, but thats always gonna be the issue for people who "just cant wait" lol
2020-09-17 02:23:24: > @Manuel Medellin unlikely. A (technically last gen) 2080Ti can still outperform both the Series X and the PS5. And the 3080 releases tomorrow, which is a 40% improvement over the 2080 Ti. What we saw in the trailer is probably not even the highest graphical settings on the PC.
2020-09-17 02:55:48: > glad we're not play as Harry
2020-09-17 03:28:14: > urbanshadow777 yo your gonna make me vomit
2020-09-17 03:39:09: > @urbanshadow777 What's there to 'hate'?
2020-09-17 03:50:32: > It's cross platform
2020-09-17 04:07:34: > Manuel Medelli it probably wont. If the pc that they captured it on is the tiniest bit decent, it will be worse graphics on ps5.
2020-09-17 04:08:19: > urbanshadow777 u clearly havent read the book 12 year old kid
2020-09-17 04:12:29: > Wonder how much the map is.. open world huh
2020-09-17 04:53:45: > yes indeed
2020-09-17 05:22:23: > I totally agree
2020-09-17 05:25:16: > Ikr.
2020-09-17 06:40:03: > It's the cinematic trailer tho.. I'd recommend wait before pre-ordering it
2020-09-17 07:00:52: > It does and I'm not even a Harry Potter fan
2020-09-16 23:28:34: Its the best time to be a gamer alot of  great new games new gpus and consoles I'm hoping the Harry potter games on pc.
2020-09-16 23:28:41: When I saw the symbol tho 
2020-09-16 23:28:47: FNAF !!!
2020-09-16 23:29:01: As a pc er, coming to ps5, ps plus collection (free ps4 hits) sold me this console. Not the new games! Except demonsouls and gow ofc..
2020-09-16 23:29:10: Amazing music 
2020-09-16 23:30:37: Watch it 17 Sep 2020

2020-09-17 00:55:11: > Xbox is going with a different direction because they are focusing on game pass instead compared to playstation
2020-09-17 00:55:39: > @Edward Degan halo looked like it was captured on a 360
2020-09-17 00:59:03: > yes yes we already heard you :D
2020-09-17 01:03:09: > @Camygael Yea after they lost to Sony and decided that mobile games (GAAS, light-content, micro-transaction laden, multiplayer focus, mindless games, F2P) are their future. I can play my mobile games on my HP cos I do have one already. Plus Microsoft has no exclusives all their games can be played on PC with better graphics, resolutions, etc.

2020-09-16 23:44:18: Demons souls looks amazing
2020-09-16 23:44:21: It starts at 58:50 or thereabouts. Cheers.

2020-09-16 23:45:08: It didnt say how much is the memory on each console?

2020-09-17 00:11:26: > why? they have 30% more power than us plebs.

2020-09-16 23:48:18: So they want us to pre-order the console tomorrow, yeah that's not going to happen, some of us are actually are in school hahahaha. So much for saving money for the console, ah Sony, Sony Sony, what do are we going to do with you.
2020-09-16 23:49:03: 1:45:54 the name of the game please ??
2020-09-16 23:49:17: What a horrible reveal. All flash and no substance. Ugly designs and even uglier presentations. More useless touch pad controls. Not even the exclusives are worth it anymore.
2020-09-16 23:49:26: Can PS5 play at 8k resolution?
2020-09-16 23:51:14: > too weak to run 100% of its games in 4k. so 8k only on some indie games.
2020-09-17 00:13:34: > @Yellow Devil 
2020-09-16 23:49:33: I was here the day that the price and the date for the PS5 was revealed
2020-09-16 23:49:35: Call of duty was an eargasm with headphones on! This gonna be awesome!

2020-09-16 23:51:36: 7.3k salty xbots   This gave me the chills feels like a proper E3-like presentation. Thank you for the hard work everyone there in Sony :)
2020-09-17 00:09:27: > why do you have to be toxic and make us regular fans look bad? ignore this if you arent 18+ yet XD
2020-09-16 23:51:41: This is how a video games livestream should be! Some other companies should learn...
2020-09-16 23:52:30: Can't lie it hit me in the feels when I saw the hall in that Harry Potter trailer.
2020-09-17 03:22:09: > Yea nobody is talking about that game bit it looked awesome and really interesting. Much more than spider man lol
2020-09-16 23:52:39: 100 Euro for a disc drive.... like really Also Demon's souls looks way to easy
2020-09-17 02:18:32: > For a *4K Ultra HD Blu-ray* disc drive
2020-09-17 02:40:27: > @Benjamin Linus 120 for us, so how many for Sony that can buy then in bulk.
2020-09-17 03:34:27: > FF16 & Harry Potter coming to PC   Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and also new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-16 23:53:12: PS5 is Awesome! Definitely worth getting it
2020-09-16 23:53:42: I really wish they would've showed us some HZD FW gameplay. But that Ragnarok reveal got me squealin!
2020-09-16 23:53:59: WHERE IS HORIZON FORBIDDEN WEST????
2020-09-17 00:07:27: > already shown off and not out till 2021/2022.

2020-09-16 23:55:01: .
2020-09-16 23:55:02: Why does Miles look like my old saints row character
2020-09-17 00:58:01: > Your character and Miles got that drip!
2020-09-16 23:55:18: I'm kind of bummed out that they didn't talk about PS now
2020-09-17 00:05:59: > irony
2020-09-16 23:55:25: Only Ogs remember when the video was an hour 47 mins long
2020-09-17 00:19:06: > Fr all the time stamps dont work now   Smh
2020-09-17 01:20:04: > @brando 26 we've been had, tricked, deceived, fooled, and quite possibly , bamboozled.
2020-09-17 07:24:29: > Call of duty ghosts 
2020-09-16 23:55:46: I'm hyped for hogwarts legacy!!
2020-09-17 03:09:11: > Goosebumps for Potterheads 
2020-09-16 23:56:24: I've left my mark here boys, remind me in 2027
2020-09-16 23:56:58: Im so disappointed they didnt show any bugsnax gameplay... 
2020-09-16 23:57:08: That was so dope!  I loved everything.  Super Nice!
2020-09-16 23:57:25: Amazing looking graphics. Hopefully it's as much fun to play as it is to look at. 
2020-09-16 23:57:43: WOOOAAHH!!!!
2020-09-16 23:58:23: Jestem szczerze rozczarowany,co z tą grafiką,miał być szał kuta.a a  widzę że nie ma co PS4 sprzedawać.
2020-09-17 00:00:26: Dear wallet,  I'm sorry.  Regards, Tofushi
2020-09-17 00:00:37: Its finally here!!!!,!,!,
2020-09-17 00:00:40: That's cool
2020-09-17 00:00:41: 400 USD is expensive? In Iran, the price of this gaming console is 15 million tomans (150 million rials)!!
2020-09-17 00:05:21: > because you like to destroy your economy over power hungry leaders and religion.
2020-09-17 00:00:44: thought godfall was meant to be a holiday 2020 title, yet no mention of it here.
2020-09-17 00:04:12: > because its only a 3rd party timed exclusive on a aa budget. not worth the screentime
2020-09-17 00:00:54: For an all digital edition, I think Sony has this... 2.5 times the tflops of the series s for $100 more.  But I think the series X is better than the disc version. For the same price, the series X is more powerful
2020-09-17 00:03:21: > yeah kinda sad to pay the same 500 for 30% less power. but hey... gamers get both systems anyway.
2020-09-17 02:57:47: > Power doesnt matter. Graphics dont matter, The spider man games looks better than halo infinite, I see your viewpoint but power does not matter
2020-09-17 03:30:57: > New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and also new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*  Sony just officially stated
2020-09-17 03:41:26: > FL33T WOOD and it still looks better than Halo Infinite
2020-09-17 00:01:01: Quero tanto, mais com certeza vai vir para o brasil a uns R$ 4.000,00 e isso é muito dinheiro por aqui.

2020-09-17 01:36:30: > thats that smile you give when you know you won again easily. RIP xbone..
2020-09-17 00:02:55: Why is this my recommended it's been 8 years! Oh wait I'm early

2020-09-17 00:04:10: 1:21:18 a game directed by Robert egers
2020-09-17 00:04:27: Wow Sony is giving the best moments of 2020 for gaming, plus 2021 the fresh start of the new era.
2020-09-17 00:05:16: people out here are commenting past an hour but the video for me is only 48 min long
2020-09-17 00:05:50: Just pre-ordered PS5. So excited, coming Nov 19th however I think Santa is delivering Christmas Eve. Be worth the wait. 
2020-09-17 00:06:09: My PS5 is now officially preordered ! Thank you guys. I can go to sleep
2020-09-17 02:13:34: > Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-17 03:07:44: > @FL33T WOOD NO WAY!
2020-09-17 03:20:34: > @Stephen Gallo Yah, Sony officially just made a low-key offical statement.  So......there's no big PS5 games so far. At this rate, keep ur hype level controlled for GoW. Just saying.....
2020-09-17 03:40:24: > FL33T WOOD that game is trash. Just like all of these.
2020-09-17 05:00:01: > @FL33T WOOD fake news and info
2020-09-17 05:44:29: > ​@FL33T WOOD Thats awesome. thats not stopping me from getting a ps5
2020-09-17 06:34:05: > where can I pre order over here in the uk?
2020-09-17 07:46:05: > How much you had to put down
2020-09-17 07:49:26: > Phillip Jackson 499 , the standard version with 4K Blu-ray player.  (With this pre-order, I won't be charged until the console ships day.)
2020-09-17 07:58:00: > Med Jay Paris how do i get the pre order in the uk?
2020-09-17 00:07:21: I was already gonna get the PS5 but now im getting a PS5 for FFXVI
2020-09-17 01:25:33: > Nah get an Xbox it is better in every way other than exclusives
2020-09-17 00:07:50: still waiting for the arrival of RDR2 in PS5 
2020-09-17 05:20:39: > Yeah, that will definitely happen!
2020-09-17 00:08:31: @ 44:10 the console wars ended. Rip Xbox
2020-09-17 00:08:44: If Kratos just sad ...BOY....the "shut-up and take my money" would be instantanally. But I`ll buy it anyway.
2020-09-17 02:51:02: > maybe that "boy" is now a young man?
2020-09-17 04:11:47: > instantanomaly
2020-09-17 00:09:07: Everything looks amazing, but I'm not actually going to buy any of these games - like they are all dark souls action games or shooters, which is basically stuff I don't play. I like the potential graphically, but I'm also happy spending 200 hours in a game like Fire Emblem or Super Mario or Breath of the Wild :/ Maybe some more actual rpgs rather than Dark-Souls wanna-be Final Fantasy would have given me a reason to be excited for PS5. Like I was a huge Final Fantasy fan, but I feel like the last game made for me was FInal Fantasy XII, which was 14 years ago now. I'm not their customer anymore obviously.
2020-09-17 00:09:09: Please give us Socom 
2020-09-17 00:09:24: what does that even mean? final fantasy exclusive on ps5.   "also available on pc" i'm confuse lol
2020-09-17 03:39:13: > *FF16  & Harry Potter coming to PC!*  Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and also new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-17 00:09:38: PlayStation is the best.    Xbox has lost definitely
2020-09-17 00:09:50: System: how long do you want the loading time takes?  PS5: "we don't do that here"
2020-09-17 02:10:34: > Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-17 02:35:54: > @FL33T WOOD really ?
2020-09-17 02:57:19: > @Devil arpan yes, Sony just released information the day before pre-orders.  They pretty much lied
2020-09-17 03:03:46: > @FL33T WOOD ok thanks
2020-09-17 07:14:29: > Coming soon: nostalgia for loading screens.

2020-09-17 00:12:06: I wish they made a new Titanfall
2020-09-17 00:12:27: Xbox has left the chat
2020-09-17 00:12:50: Ah, yes. FANF!
2020-09-17 00:12:57: I mean... eh? I've been getting sony stuff as soon as I can since the ps1, but I'm gonna wait until there's a lite or something on the ps5. Price is too high for South America right now, specially Brazil. I'm glad I'm building a somewhat strong pc for this next generation.
2020-09-17 00:13:09: Anyone else wondering why this wasnt presented in 4K?
2020-09-17 03:42:46: > Because PS5 isn't that powerful, they use a PC to showcase FF16, no PS5 exclusives  Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and also new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-17 00:13:29: Its 2025 and this is in your recommendations...
2020-09-17 00:14:10: Only game I found interesting was spider man.  FF looked great but was running on a pc.
2020-09-17 01:51:12: > play spider-man on your ps4 if you want. will still look great.
2020-09-17 00:14:39: Soooooooo... black ops cold war is set in 1982 and all that technology and cars were present in that time?
2020-09-17 00:15:05: Wow im so excited for all these games already think ps5 won no doubt
2020-09-17 00:15:13: Just wanting on sly cooper lol
2020-09-17 06:51:02: > I want ape escape, sly cooper and Jak and Daxter.
2020-09-17 06:57:17: > I feel like Sly Cooper will come back in the future.
2020-09-17 00:15:26: That   flag on the balcony tho 
2020-09-17 00:15:29: After one week of release  And now we release a pro version and a slim version We wont lower the prices just make them higher

2020-09-17 00:16:14: I was here :D
2020-09-17 00:16:45: I hope that there'll be other options beyond white.... that's just gross looking.
2020-09-17 00:16:55: Oh i see Final Fantasy 168... nice!
2020-09-17 00:18:45: So do I get it right, when I have PS Plus, I can play that PS4 greatest hits on PS5?
2020-09-17 00:18:52: Finally got to see the rear of the console. PS5 gonna be sick!!!
2020-09-17 03:37:58: > FF16  & Harry Potter coming to PC!  Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and also new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-17 03:44:24: > We've seen how short the development time for PS5 is and also these Devs are used to working with the PS4, so it's very likely they won't be held back by it.
2020-09-17 00:19:09: LOLOLOL Harlem?????  Covered in skyscrapers and neons   LOLOLOL  Fail
2020-09-17 00:19:22: And thats why PS5 is better than XBOX
2020-09-17 00:20:00: Surprised I didn't hear "Why did I move here?"
2020-09-17 00:20:05: When you saved money for a PS5 but your mom said no
2020-09-17 01:55:39: > irony. horizon 2, miles morales etc. are on ps4 too.
2020-09-17 00:20:06: WE NEED GTA (6)
2020-09-17 00:20:11: Wow final fantasy xvi is hella hot.
2020-09-17 00:20:33: Bro, similar performance (maybe better) than Xbox Series X ... AND $100 CHEAPER?? Digital Edition all the way.
2020-09-17 00:34:40: > 30% less powerful....
2020-09-17 00:20:36: *Playstation console exclusive*          *Also available on pc*
2020-09-17 00:20:48: The real question is how do I get my hands on the black version
2020-09-17 00:21:06: Miles Morales better fail in saving some people in this game because its bs if he saves everyone as a rookie hero.
2020-09-17 00:21:07: "...captured on PC emulating the PS5 experience" LOL
2020-09-17 00:21:10: demons souls on pc is real???? wooow thank you.... now i will download it for free.... thank you playstation....XDDDDD
2020-09-17 00:21:26: wait where's GTA 6
2020-09-17 00:21:35: So  About that price
2020-09-17 00:22:19: Is ff 16 online game? Looks like continuation of 14 to me
2020-09-17 00:32:41: > Singleplayer
2020-09-17 00:34:01: > @Yellow Devil oh i see. The main character is too generic. Lookslike character  you can create in ff 14.
2020-09-17 00:36:59: > @Steven Pram looks like a fire emblem char with less colors
2020-09-17 00:53:37: > @Yellow Devil yes. Usually ff main character is over the top than the other npc hahah this looks the same

2020-09-17 00:23:14: I have bought every Playstation console, but I am thinking of just sticking with PC gaming and Nintendo during the upcoming console generation. I haven't been impressed by most of the exclusives from either Sony or Microsoft lately. And I have been finding better exclusives on Steam.
2020-09-17 00:23:28: New Spidey game looks gorgeous!
2020-09-17 00:23:51: What would be the price in India?
2020-09-17 00:24:00: Yes, where going back to Vietnam (Call Duty: Black Ops Cold War)
2020-09-17 00:24:37: Real question is can we get our digital ps4 games on ps5
2020-09-17 00:32:17: > not all of them. some at launch, others later.
2020-09-17 00:33:11: > @Yellow Devil thanks for the info broski i just wanna play titanfall 2 on ps5

2020-09-17 00:25:48: 
2020-09-17 00:26:17: This... was amazing!
2020-09-17 00:26:31: Awesome !!!  I'll wait for the PS5 Pro  LOL
2020-09-17 00:27:03: i choked on the last teaser.
2020-09-17 08:36:38: > choked the chicken?

2020-09-17 00:27:27: Hi
2020-09-17 00:27:50: These shows become more underwhelming with every passing year.
2020-09-17 00:41:47: > I'm not impressed
2020-09-17 03:36:57: > FF16  & Harry Potter coming to PC!  Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and also new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-17 00:28:14: Please tell me that music is going to be actually in the game for miles morales Spiderman
2020-09-17 00:28:21: Song at the end during price reveal?

2020-09-17 00:29:19: The real question is whats worth it digital version or disc?
2020-09-17 00:29:35: Sony came out swinging
2020-09-17 00:29:41: Permaban Mouse and Keyboard users on competitive games on PS

2020-09-17 00:29:58: I want to see FIFA, NBA2K and GTAV !
2020-09-17 00:30:02: One thing  The download of the games for the PS+ better be a bonus, and not how they're doing "Backwards compatibility", I will actually be angry
2020-09-17 00:30:44: I hope the ps5 startup sound will be similar or an enhanced version that of ps1.
2020-09-17 00:30:45: 할부인건가요?
2020-09-17 00:31:03: Who'd have thought it. The bethesda game has worst graphics.
2020-09-17 00:31:31: Excited for final fantasy finally going back to medieval era and boi do that spiderman miles morales gameplay looks fluid,pretty and a fast transition with those ssd also been waiting for this new harry potter 'rpg' genre since that leaked years ago.hats off to playstation for this event

2020-09-17 00:35:45: am i the only one whos wasnt impressed by this showcase. don't get me wrong the games look fun and well done but there was nothing in this that impressed me.
2020-09-17 00:35:47: Why are they showcasing a 4k/60 fps console with 1080p 30fps video?
2020-09-17 00:35:47: Awesome PlayStation 5 Showcase Video.
2020-09-17 00:36:03: Minecraft 2
2020-09-17 00:36:32: xbox fans are letting the salt flow on the dislikes. Yup this gen is going to sony again maybe next gen xbox
2020-09-17 01:53:30: > I wasn't really interested because all of the PS exclusives are going to be on PC. So what's the point on getting a PS?
2020-09-17 02:41:43: > @Jackaboy that is a lie my boy demon souls is ps5 exclusive if you do a quick search on google demons souls remake on pc was a mistake it will only be on ps5
2020-09-17 00:37:25: The price???

2020-09-17 11:51:53: > @N.E.S. thank, im to lazy to watch entire video
2020-09-17 00:37:49: My dream's of console new generation. I love it, I love Playstation 5. Que venham para nós com um bom $$$$preço $ in Brazil.
2020-09-17 00:38:01: Proud PS and Xbox owner, but this showcase was just better !
2020-09-17 00:38:05: Me: yo, I cant wait to see the spider man movie. Sony: you do know these are games that are coming to PS5? *me now realizing the graphics of the PS5*
2020-09-17 01:45:21: > irony. spider-man, horizon 2 and others are on ps4
2020-09-17 00:38:09: 
2020-09-17 00:38:38: Is that FF16 is on ivalice? If true... That will be interesting af!

2020-09-17 01:59:17: > could have just played spider-man, horizon 2 etc on your ps4.
2020-09-17 00:41:07: forget the switch, forget Nvidia RTX 30 series, who cares about Xbox series x and s, Playstation has called me to come back and I will return
2020-09-17 01:19:19: > The new Xbox generation is better in every way though other than exclusives
2020-09-17 00:41:29: PS5 is the obvious choice now
2020-09-17 00:42:16: That was absolutely great. I love u so much playstation ️️
2020-09-17 00:42:40: Gud Graphs
2020-09-17 00:42:43: Why is it 700 dollars in my country I thot it was 500
2020-09-17 00:43:00: Am I the only one who wants a puppeteer remaster?
2020-09-17 00:43:04: I have to say... I'm more excited with the new PS5 than the Xbox. I don't know if there will be a new Xbox event coming, but, at this point, I'm going with PS5.
2020-09-17 01:21:33: > Why Xbox is better in every way this time around other than exclusives
2020-09-17 01:51:11: > So far, neither of them are impressing me. Was thinking about buying a PlayStation but then they revealed that the exclusives are going to be on PC so what's the point? I am probably going to just buy Xbox because some of my old friends still have it. But that's just me
2020-09-17 00:43:33: this is how you tell a price is worth it
2020-09-17 00:44:51: When is the launch
2020-09-17 00:45:35: Could i pre-order all ready ??
2020-09-17 00:46:21: I Want Ps5 ._.
2020-09-17 00:46:52: An announcement that included: the new console; release date and price; many of the best games from the PS4 included as a collection; more game play from previously announced titles (Demon's Souls!); new games like Final Fantasy 16, and a teaser for the return of Kratos.  That was a fun thing to watch and I am looking forward to the new adventures!
2020-09-17 02:11:17: > Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-17 06:07:44: > When does it say the release date and price of the ps5?

2020-09-17 06:27:51: > Cai Chendong Thanks!
2020-09-17 06:47:10: > Wait price I never saw a price
2020-09-17 06:51:50: > @The king of Cats its the 2nd to last thing they show
2020-09-17 08:19:39: > what a out spiderman miles and morales gameplay
2020-09-17 11:23:12: > @FL33T WOOD no body cares if those games comes to PS4 I'm more than happy with that decision
2020-09-17 12:32:21: > @Tapan Kamila Over 100 million PS4 gamers do
2020-09-17 12:34:14: > @Kevin Piña why would anyone be angered? This is great news for PS4.  But the fact that Sony kept hiding information the night before pre-orders is shady
2020-09-17 12:42:09: > The king of Cats check the pinned comment with timestamps
2020-09-17 14:37:15: > @FL33T WOOD maybe .. but I don't
2020-09-17 15:28:47: > @Tapan Kamila Sounds great, then ur initial comment "nobody cares" was irrelevant.
2020-09-17 18:37:41: > @FL33T WOOD ask most people The will say they don't care
2020-09-17 00:47:01: 1:42:38 this is what you all came for
2020-09-17 00:47:06: can i put the ps4 disk on the ps5 so I can play it?
2020-09-17 00:47:29: White is bright Blue is true Hang in there players I am coming for you !!!!
2020-09-17 00:48:23: FIVE NIGHTS AT FREDYS
2020-09-17 00:48:48: these just cutscenes mehh
2020-09-17 00:48:53: Demon Souls looks incredible and we finally get a legit Harry Potter game!?
2020-09-17 00:49:05: This looks awesome
2020-09-17 00:49:11: I was pogging when I saw the owl because of guardians of gahoole but  it's just Harry Potter instead. Wait never mind still pogging
2020-09-17 00:49:38: Always remember, nothing is as it seems
2020-09-17 00:50:24: Playstation : Price Has No Limits
2020-09-17 00:50:36: $499 w/ disk drive $399 all digital
2020-09-17 00:51:50: You guys just showed me where I should spend my money and its with you
2020-09-17 00:51:58: FF --- *Also available on PC ....... well now. If this trend continues, just as it did with Xbox, I will no longer have use for a console.
2020-09-17 02:12:53: > Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-17 02:43:21: > Plenty of final fantasies are on PC already, and Xbox is a unique case as its owned my Microsoft. I wouldnt get your hopes up, PC would probably never get GOW or anything, might get HZD.
2020-09-17 02:47:20: > @FL33T WOOD braking news xbox got no exclusives.
2020-09-17 02:53:29: > FF is a third party exclusive. It is up to Square where FF goes beyond console.
2020-09-17 02:56:10: > FL33T WOOD Yes, after the whole generations nonsense Jim Ryan said. They are going after software sales. Minus the SSD speed, faster loading times, haptic feedback, and perhaps higher resolution/ray tracing itll be the same.   Sony needs to get their marketing department in check. Not a Jim Ryan fan either since his Gran Turismo remarks.
2020-09-17 03:24:07: > @Mr4K HDR ff as in F16? Also confirmed to be coming to PC
2020-09-17 03:36:15: > don't worry about ff16, when ff16 is on the market you can almost buy ps5 pro....
2020-09-17 06:35:37: > FF games are usually available on PC anyway
2020-09-17 11:30:24: > 1 year timed exclusive just like FF7 remake
2020-09-17 11:31:14: > @FL33T WOOD 1 year later Just like FF7 Remake
2020-09-17 13:28:29: > Tapan Kamila I dont think its ever coming to Xbox this time. The amount of player base is just too low
2020-09-17 14:30:51: > @Worawat Srisawasdi yup.. Xbox won't gonna get FF 16 But PC users also have to wait for a year after releasing on PS5
2020-09-17 15:10:11: > Cant compare Xbox to PlayStation. Xbox only cares about game pass. Whereas, PlayStation cares about making high quality exclusive games.
2020-09-17 17:17:49: > @Worawat Srisawasdi Well apparently they don't care about making exclusives anymore
2020-09-17 00:51:59: And yet still nothing on backwards compatibility, if it hasn't got it then I'm just not bothering I've no room for more consoles
2020-09-17 00:52:01: 43:20
2020-09-17 00:52:19: £450 converts to $582, how do you justify ripping off people in the UK and Europe.
2020-09-17 00:52:25: people are sleeping on deathloop the concept looks great and arkane studios never dissapoints
2020-09-17 00:52:42: Nothing will ever beat a Cold War games feel that is Metal Gear Solid 3. That game is too awesome and CoDBOCW can not compare
2020-09-17 00:52:52: Hogwarts audio sound like avengers introduction.
2020-09-17 00:53:21: great showcase of PS5
2020-09-17 00:53:27: I was waiting/hoping for elder scrolls 6 but I dong think its ever coming out
2020-09-17 07:18:11: > Elder Scrollls 6 is still in the making, TBA trailer is expected around 2022 or 2024 there its a long game

2020-09-17 01:01:04: Really worth it especially when you didnt get a PS 4 now you have such a huge Variety of games to play all Night long, hopefully backwards compatibility for PS X, PS 2 and PS 3 games as well

2020-09-17 01:03:58: Anyone know why it's more expensive in terms of euros and pounds, but cheaper in yen? Does it have to do with the distribution or something?
2020-09-17 01:05:58: see you all in 5 years when YouTube reccomends this again

2020-09-17 01:07:54: Is it just me or something. FFXVI graphics look the same as FFXV. especially during the battle scene. will this game also be available on ps4?
2020-09-17 01:07:59: Woahhh ff xvi is a PS exclusive???
2020-09-17 01:08:21: I wasted all that time for this? A bunch of trailers for mostly games we knew were coming and a price reveal for what we already guessed it would be? No info that will actually help us make the decision between PS and XBOX? Can we get official word on if the PS5 will have backward compatibility for PS3, PS2, and PS1 disks?
2020-09-17 01:09:28: Hogwarts legacy, demon souls, and Spider-Man is what I'm here for

2020-09-30 10:55:00: > @Demser DvM Exactly. These PC bafoons think themselves of so highly that playing on console will kill them. Some PS4 exclusives will come to PC in the future but who cares  We'll have already played even the sequels to the exclusives by then with *far* less bugs 
2020-10-10 00:22:59: > COOL. I'M BUYING ALL THOSE GAMES FOR MY PC.

2020-09-17 01:16:01: the people who didn't like were Xbox people
2020-09-17 01:43:34: > No I didn't really care because all of these games are going to PC is so why would I get a PS5?
2020-09-17 02:06:40: > Jackaboy Reasons why  1. Ps5 is already better when it comes to price+quality (this DOESNT mean that ps5 has better quality. This means that if your gonna have a pc setup as expensive as the ps5. The ps5 will have greater quality when it comes to FPS, graphics, and more). 2. The ability to just chill in the living room while playing with friends 3. PC is not a console. A lot of people prefer console gaming.
2020-09-17 01:16:18: There are No NFS Games on PS5
2020-09-17 01:16:54: So glad they didn't make a FF 15 - 2

2020-09-17 04:36:11: > To me it's more magical I liked It

2020-09-17 01:19:13: Im leaving Xbox....       For PC
2020-09-17 01:42:56: > Join us my comrade. PC is really epic. Especially when PS is literally giving all of their exclusives to PC now.
2020-09-17 02:37:52: > Spend 5000 dollars while we here spend 500
2020-09-17 01:19:15: Fnaf

2020-09-17 01:21:56: Is the ps5 backwards compatible? Cause if so I think that would count as a "limit".

2020-09-17 01:29:17: Truly one of the best showcases Ive seen in awhile.
2020-09-17 01:30:43: Hopefully they get rid of that annoying download after buying a digital disc why cant they have it install into it already (not the updates thats different)
2020-09-17 01:30:57: The Harry Potter game probably looked the best in the showcase. I'm surprised.
2020-09-17 01:40:25: > These games don't really look too bad. But certainly not next generation.
2020-09-17 01:30:58: When I Hear Kratos voice I say Coñoooooooo OhhhhMyyyyF°°°°°°°Goddddddd  Sony Like Always U Win Thanks...
2020-09-17 01:31:17: You have to be mad to pay those prices just get a pc btw before people say Im pc master race Im not Ive been a long time PlayStation fan but these prices are way to high just ridiculous I can get a decent spec pc that does way more for the price especially when the new graphics cards are coming out which will make the other cards dirt cheap.

2020-09-17 05:28:37: > User Name i guess you like to play different types of games
2020-09-17 02:40:25: Sony Exec. #1: What games should we push in our opening hype trailer? Sony Exec. #2: Bug Snax. Definitely Bug Snax.
2020-09-17 02:40:29: Will these games come on PS4 also ???
2020-09-17 02:40:46: Hyped about the ps5 but im starting to wonder what special games will it have because of its new ssd system. If its going to have the same games as pc or xbox but slightly faster load times then its kind of not worth it. Are we going to get special edition of games like gta v but with proper speeds on jets because the ssd can load the world fast enough? What is this console's selling point? Smaller games sizes or open worlds with unique travel systems that only a ps5 can do? Is there a video that explains any of this
2020-09-17 02:50:16: > its only advantage is a slightly faster speed , but xbox is slightly more powerful. differences so small you wont actually be able to tell them apart while playing. might as well get a pc cuz basically all the games are going to pc anyway
2020-09-17 02:40:59: Im naming my kid SONY. Nuff said
2020-09-17 02:41:48: FFXVI such a disappointment. put high hope on it.

2020-09-17 02:54:35: 43:19  Well, at least now I know the price and I'm completely sure that my other kidney must be sold...
2020-09-17 05:23:46: > I don't even have money to buy a single game....  Sad life
2020-09-17 06:08:43: > @Ajay singh Me neither...
2020-09-17 06:26:51: > How can you not afford 300-400 euro/dollar? This is like a newspaper job for like 5 hours a WEEK lol
2020-09-17 06:34:38: > @David Rakoczy I don't know where you live, but in my country, a minimum wage is 100 dollars per month. AND, the prices change everyday because the inflation. They always go higher and higher. A thing that cost 100, tomorrow will cost 150, and the next week it'll cost 300.   Edit: also, taxes are so fricking high that half of our incoming are spent in just that. If you add the food shopping... Well, you just can't save any money.  Sorry for my bad English.
2020-09-17 06:51:59: > Ciro Mira Whats the equivalent of $100 in your country?
2020-09-17 06:56:25: > @BlackMamba 0824 $1 is $130/140 (I'm not sure, they change it almost everyday and I didn't see the news today), so $100 is around $13.000.   Last time I saw, minimum wage was $16.000, so that's like 120 dollars. Again, I don't know the exact number of a minimum wage, because I didn't see the news today.
2020-09-17 07:09:35: > @David Rakoczy well things are different with taxes xbox series s which cost 249$ in US costs 501$ with taxes in my country and 499$ console costs 700$ with taxes. Ps per capita income is around 2k-3k$ so basically an average income is around 2-3k dollars a year with full 9-5 jobs lol
2020-09-17 07:55:45: > @David Rakoczy bro... its simple   i am not rich  ;(  and when i'll achieve what i want my room will be full of games and ps5..  :)  till then..  i'm just struggling
2020-09-17 07:58:31: > @Ciro Mira BTW where do you live?
2020-09-17 08:08:24: > @Ajay singh Argentina... we are in really bad conditions right now...
2020-09-17 08:24:06: > @Ciro Mira India also.... even i haven't bought a single game in my life and i am watching ps5 video... IDK why?   XD
2020-09-17 12:40:57: > Ciro Mira so youre telling me you dont know the minimum wage of your own country that youre living in rn. You can just basically search it up on google
2020-09-17 18:01:57: > @BlackMamba 0824 I'm telling you that I don't know because it changes EVERYDAY. Sorry for not having a stable economy OK?
2020-09-17 18:02:56: > It might be a number now and a different one in some hours or days.
2020-09-17 18:26:52: > Ciro Mira u basically capping but its alright smh
2020-09-17 21:51:44: > @BlackMamba 0824 I've just seen  again. Right now, 9/17/20, the minimum wage is $16.515 per month. One dollar is $135 today.
2020-09-17 02:54:53: Should I buy the digital ps5 or disc version
2020-09-17 02:59:25: > With disc version you can play even if you dont have internet im guessing.I just hope disc version also has ssd,and an ability to download games from internet.

2020-09-17 03:19:47: hi Brian Horton where in your game children? -_-
2020-09-17 03:20:02: So well be able to Pre-order on the 17th?
2020-09-17 15:00:09: > Thats what they said but there sold out everywhere on the 16th
2020-09-17 03:20:19: I DON'T NEED PS5 to play those games
2020-09-17 11:52:23: > You indeed need a PS5  to enjoy those games
2020-09-17 03:20:23: I thought it was Gordon Ramsay in the end
2020-09-17 03:20:49: Noone talking about the price. Noone talking about DualSense. Noone talking about the games. All that matters is, its new & shiny.
2020-09-17 03:21:17: I don't see subnautica. Wow
2020-09-17 03:21:52: Cheaper, better expected performance (only IT illiterates put stock in those 2 extra TFLOPS), myriad of _superior_ exclusives, and a big ole basket of classic freebies.  Yeah, I'm calling it. Rest In Peace Xbox Series whatever.
2020-09-17 11:42:31: > Spot on mate
2020-09-17 12:44:11: > At least our games aren't 70 dollars
2020-09-17 12:53:16: > fesh a voca do its a set of both Spider-Man games remastered and combined ......technically 2 games so 35$ each ......and correct me if I am wrong
2020-09-17 13:04:08: > @Jody Barker thats very true, but unlike the series s and x the digital version has the same specs as the disc drive version.
2020-09-17 13:08:30: > @Jody Barker It also has more than $100 less power. Wasn't that thoughtful of them?
2020-09-17 14:33:54: > @Jody Barker you are comparing apples with berries  PS5  DE is the same console as the Physical PS5 just with out a disk drive And Series S is a much much weaker console( and has a only storage capacity of 512 GB) than  both Series X and PS5
2020-09-17 15:01:46: > @Tapan Kamila Careful my guy, don't want to risk being called a shill for pointing out the blisteringly obvious. Just keep quiet and let our boy Jody here think he has a point in comparing dissimilar products. Only a "Sony pony" and a "shill" would take issue with such peasant trifles like using broken logic to make one company look better than ano-... Oh.. Oh dear.
2020-09-17 18:40:53: > @A Duck oh I get it Thanks mate
2020-09-17 03:23:29: Give me dj alok bhai
2020-09-17 03:23:40: Wut do ya mean rest of the world in 19 th November
2020-09-17 07:00:46: > In November 12th PS5 only release on US, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea country.  But November 19th, it will release on other country (all of them) you understand?
2020-09-17 03:23:55: I was literally clapping at the end of that Miles Morales showcase.
2020-09-17 03:28:55: > Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and also new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-17 04:06:16: > Did you know you can leave out that pointless "nobody" part and still get your point across without looking like a 12 year old who doesn't do anything other than look at memes
2020-09-17 05:53:20: > Nobody... Literally everybody... Nobody.. and the cicle repeats until every last brain cell is lost to the void
2020-09-17 09:00:57: > @TMeek94 I'm sorry you don't understand the concept of free speech. Maybe you don't really have anything better to do either. I'll comment what I want, how I want & when I want. Too many people are afraid of being themselves as it is & people like you make it worse.
2020-09-17 13:12:17: > Nikhil P. Youre not being yourself though, youre being like everyone else, thats his point. Its annoying to see comments deprived of any creativity.
2020-09-17 15:36:27: > I changed it. You guys need to chill. It's just a comment. lol
2020-09-17 19:23:50: > 1 down boys, only 1 billion left to go gang. Lets go get em
2020-09-17 03:24:03: Jee I hope 2021 is going to be better than 2020 2021: 38:24
2020-09-17 03:24:24: 
2020-09-17 03:24:43: When release ps5 please replay me
2020-09-17 03:24:57: Where is spiderman miles morales second trailer?
2020-09-17 03:25:28: spider man faster web swinging speed very interesting
2020-09-17 03:25:36: 03:52 that fire monster gave me MGSV vibes
2020-09-17 03:26:02: Demon's soul is the best remake i have ever seen in the videogames it looks soooo realistic ps5 rocks
2020-09-17 07:42:25: > They are using ray traced global illumination that's why it looks so realistic. I want to see what the next Unreal 5 game will be like. That's probably gonna blow our socks off lemme tell you.
2020-09-17 11:28:11: > Ever played Control on PC?
2020-09-17 11:32:18: > @v i k e h t o yes... What about that game?
2020-09-17 20:48:52: > @Tapan Kamila Its impressive isnt it? With the new rtx cards you can run the game on max at native 4k resolution and ray tracing at 60fps with dlss. Cant wait to see what more these new cards will offer. So stoked!
2020-09-17 03:26:04: The new cod looks incredibly boring.
2020-09-17 03:26:24: John Jameson would have a field day with that bridge incident. "Spider-Man destroys bridge and takes credit for saving lives he put in Danger"
2020-09-17 03:27:05: GTA VI
2020-09-17 03:27:28: Sony using PC to show us the "PS5 Experience".
2020-09-17 03:33:31: > No PS5 exclusives, FF16 coming to PC, same with Harry Potter   New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and also new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-17 03:27:33: I got recommended this video after 8 yrs      SERIOUSLY
2020-09-17 03:27:55: Kratos
2020-09-17 03:28:00: China won't get this  . .. . . .  Thanx.
2020-09-17 03:28:14: So it should be 424 cause dollar is weaker, why is that?
2020-09-17 03:28:15: Final Fantasy XVI looks boring a.f.
2020-09-17 03:28:19: I'm glad that even if for profit, somebody has picked up the harry potter universe and decided to carry it. Atleast children will have an idea about what it is.
2020-09-17 14:36:58: > Yes
2020-09-17 15:51:09: > Children who play that game will be misled into thinking that England was racially diverse in the 1800s. Lol...
2020-09-17 19:28:18: > @An Owl it's a fake video game who cares?? I play to have fun not to be historically accurate that's for simulations
2020-09-17 21:50:51: > @Ser Josh They do it becouse they hate white people and deny whites any identity if their own. It's sick.
2020-09-17 03:28:34: 
2020-09-17 03:28:42: 43 worthless minutes just so I could find out they are indeed going to undercut the Xbox.
2020-09-17 03:39:34: > FF16  & Harry Potter coming to PC!  Breaking News: New *SpiderMan Miles Morales* and also new *Horizon Forbidden West* games *coming to the "PS4"*
2020-09-17 03:29:09: sony has become a virtue signaling tool for the left. if you are republican or if you are a normal sane human being do not fund this agenda do not buy ps5 or any more playstation games.
2020-09-17 03:29:18: elden ring¿¿¿
2020-09-17 03:29:37: Okay, i badly want demon's souls since i didn't play it before aswell as the remake looks so stunning.... though is it worth buying PS5 for just this? That's another question :D
2020-09-17 03:33:15: > Its also $70. In Australia its cost $129.
2020-09-17 03:29:38: I hope we dont see a Skyrim ray tracing edition. Its been a long year, let the game laid to rest.
2020-09-17 03:29:48: Quem nasce para ser Rei, nunca perde a Majestade.
2020-09-17 03:29:55: Last night my family just broke up. I was soooooo upset. And now i am like, f*ck family, this is best day of my entire life.
2020-09-17 03:29:56: Wow!
2020-09-17 03:30:07: This year is so awesome... Ps5, Xbox Series, RTX 3080, Iphone 12... While my wallet is silently crying in the corner. It's ok wallet i'll only chose one or maybe two. hehe
2020-09-17 03:30:17: I missed it :( it was at 1:30 am
2020-09-17 06:56:57: > For me it was 3 am
2020-09-17 03:31:36: They should just call it the PS4-2. These graphics are not looking Next-Gen at all.
2020-09-17 03:31:56: I wanted to see horizon forbidden west..cant wait..
2020-09-17 03:32:25: kratos to xbox : dont be sorry be better
2020-09-17 03:33:56: That music was banging when they revealed the release date. Anyone have a link to the extended version?
2020-09-17 16:46:28: > This is the extended version
2020-09-17 03:34:08: Well at least it's better than 599 US dollars.
2020-09-17 03:35:03: The full-fledged title about Hogwarts with that Harry Potter theme in the background hit me with all kinds of nostalgia! Love it!
2020-09-17 03:35:03: Console looks cool, but these games all look stupid.
2020-09-17 03:40:41: > Thank you Gary Oak very cool
2020-09-17 03:35:18: I laughed hard at the Final Fantasy's trailer "PlayStation exclusive (but also available for PC)"
2020-09-17 03:40:30: > plenty of games are available on a console and on PC, anymore being an exclusive just means that it will only be for 1 console
2020-09-17 04:06:45: > Well Sony already said that more exclusives will also be available on PC, not all but more, and I think PC players will have to wait years for PS exclusives to come because I don't think they will be available on the same release date.
2020-09-17 11:27:19: > Not until for a year
2020-09-17 13:59:46: > Meanwhile xbox has an entire game pass on pc. We are both laughing stocks and pc are collecting all the goods
2020-09-17 14:54:28: > "Timed-Exclusive"  
2020-09-17 16:05:07: > Console Exclusive****
2020-09-17 16:05:59: > That's like all xbox exclusives in a nutshell LOL
2020-09-17 16:57:53: > They called it a console exclusive for a reason
2020-09-17 17:03:21: > It said console exclusive.
2020-09-17 17:05:24: > They teased Xbox by saying console exclusive
2020-09-17 22:47:20: > I really appreciate your great work @Vikehacks on Instagram he is reliable and perfect for any kind of hack job you can reach him on instagram @Vikehacks
2020-09-17 22:47:22: > @Marz Pacas years? I don't think so, that is what you wish, haha!!!
2020-09-17 23:44:05: > @Maximo Paz Do you want me to remind you how many years PS players enjoyed Horizon Zero Down before it became available on pc? Thats like giving you used toys bru haha
2020-09-17 03:35:46: Thank u Playstation

2020-09-17 03:42:31: Paying $500 just to get a new console with slightly better graphics... I was expecting something more innovative from Sony.
2020-09-17 03:42:50: ️️️️️
2020-09-17 03:43:35: CANT WAIT FOR GTA 6 ON PS5

2020-09-17 03:49:24: Meh, politics and social issues are more fun for me these days.

2020-09-17 03:51:12: *goosebumps*
2020-09-17 03:51:14: Captured on PC,emulating PS5?!!! That's a massive FAIL Sony. Why not post straight up PS5? Suspicious AF.
2020-09-17 03:51:49: Aquí en mexicooo el 12 UwU
2020-09-17 03:52:24: It's great but... Where is Metal Gear Solid games? Where is Mgs VI? Or Mgs Legendary Collection or something? I want Snake to comeback! 
2020-09-17 21:52:45: > Konami

2020-09-17 03:53:21: Yoooooo Where is Playstation All Stars battle royale 2?????
2020-09-17 03:53:30: I've never been one to like FPS games as much as I like other types but Cold War looks sick!
2020-09-17 03:53:34: В поряде!!!
2020-09-17 03:54:08: I hope the dualsense is waterproof
2020-09-17 03:54:09: Blacks Ops Cold War single player campaign probably 2 hours long if that...
2020-09-17 03:54:22: Wanted to buy PS5 at start, but now there is no point. Will wait for some great games year or two and all black color. Lame. Most of the games we already saw on last showcase. I hoped for something new. This showcase was mostly pointless. They could just drop the prices in Twitter like MS did.
2020-09-17 03:54:37: PS4 I haven't bought yet, PS5 is about to be released ... Poor For Me 
2020-09-17 04:08:22: > You know a thought and imagination of one person is strong.What you imagine,think and say becomes your reality.
2020-09-17 11:38:45: > I think am gonna buy ps5 and skip ps4
2020-09-18 00:17:07: > @Vidmantask Vidmantask yep.
2020-09-17 03:55:04: Who wanted uncharted
2020-09-17 03:56:25: Gameplay of Final Fantasy XVI look even more action based than before... Why when mobile games are embracing turn based battles...
2020-09-17 03:56:40: Why i am the rest of the world
2020-09-17 11:43:44: > Same where do you live
2020-09-17 03:57:23: PlayStation: Price Me:          *hot doogly moogly*
2020-09-17 03:57:28: Can we play both CD and DIGITAL games on PS5 CD Edition
2020-09-17 04:03:36: > Iam pretty sure. Just downloading from the ps now. $100 for blue ray disk drive.iam getting cd version. Digital looks more sleek. But cant part way with the disc quite yet.
2020-09-17 03:57:36: "The following content is captured from PC emulating PS5" Transparency, I like that!
2020-09-17 03:57:39: When do we get to see the special liquid metal heatsink?
2020-09-17 03:58:56: Playstation digital is a nice competition to xbox series s. if you look you can get a 4k 60 fps console just by a paying a 100$ extra.
2020-09-17 03:59:12: Well then... looks like people are gonna have to dig deep for $400 or $500 to buy this.
2020-09-17 03:59:24: Xbox : WE GONNA WIN BRO... PS : "Release the Kratos"
2020-09-17 04:13:49: > Never will xbox win in anything
2020-09-17 04:16:10: > xbox's new console looks bad
2020-09-17 04:18:24: > xbox is going to win
2020-09-17 04:19:38: > @demonic chair666 go away
2020-09-17 04:24:11: > Anakin Skywalker playastation has the high ground
2020-09-17 04:24:39: > Muhammad Musa Haider you underestimate xbox's power
2020-09-17 04:25:34: > Muhammad Musa Haider seriously tho,playstation is not worth feeding,im coming from ps4 now and im really not satysfied in playstation 5
2020-09-17 04:26:25: > Muhammad Musa Haider its like buying gtx 1050 ti instead of rx570 or rx580
2020-09-17 04:27:16: > @demonic chair666 bruh they don't even have any games what would you play on xbox?
2020-09-17 04:28:32: > Normal Gamer i cant see anything that can top xbox s,im not gonna buy any console cause i dont see anything valuable in ps5 other than 4 games
2020-09-17 04:31:19: > Anakin Skywalker if you can buy a pc with a 3080 why on earth would you buy a console for its graphics?? Consoles are purely for exclusive titles and PS4 wins that. Also for what platform your friends are on, mine are ps4
2020-09-17 04:35:38: > @Normal Gamer I'm going Xbox mostly for Fable 4 and halo 6.
2020-09-17 04:37:30: > Yes Bruv you know,it isnt really cool if cheap xbox beats ps5 in its power.ps4's con was it was cheap,and more powerful than original xbox 1
2020-09-17 04:38:02: > Yes Bruv we have to look straight,xbox wins by its price/quality
2020-09-17 04:39:11: > Yes Bruv who buys consoles for consoles,maybe some,but consoles are mainly bought for cod,battlefield,ac,fifa and xbox wins that.i bought ps4 for these and,it won over xbox on that
2020-09-17 04:46:17: > Anakin Skywalker I dont understand whats that got anything to do with what I just said lol?
2020-09-17 04:47:04: > Yes Bruv wh
2020-09-17 04:47:24: > Yes Bruv oh,there was an error,"who buys consoles for exclusives"
2020-09-17 04:48:11: > Anakin Skywalker if you want some noticeable graphics FPS performance get a high end pc. Consoles are for exclusives and friends. Ps destroys Xbox with exclusives
2020-09-17 04:51:48: > @demonic chair666 why i have to buy powerfull console that has no "GAMES"  Playstation literally has tasty and powerfull franchise from ps1 too ps5, but my opinion xbox has nothin.
2020-09-17 06:34:35: > Anakin Skywalker Craig, is that you?
2020-09-17 06:51:39: > @Aoi Zen 100% AGREED...
2020-09-17 06:52:19: > @Normal Gamer TRUE BRO..
2020-09-17 08:58:56: > Xbox the best
2020-09-17 10:00:18: > Anakin Skywalker PlayStation outsold every Xbox generation and this one is going to be easy
2020-09-17 18:52:48: > @Jaymz Savage wow two games you can get on PC lol
2020-09-17 18:53:46: > @Momo lop it already happened lol
2020-09-17 19:45:49: > demonic chair666 the cheap xbox will not be stronger than the digital and regular ps5. The reason that series s is so cheap is because it has worse specs than the series x. The digital and regular ps5 will have the same specs, except for the disk drive of course
2020-09-17 20:07:33: > Oliphant Kid yup I see that
2020-09-17 23:17:16: > @Aoi Zen have you seen gamepass ultimate? Try to beat that
2020-09-18 00:14:49: > Release the Kratos, the Souls, the Noctis, the Spiderman
2020-09-18 03:03:25: > Mili 98   Exactly its all gonna be awesome...
2020-09-18 03:04:47: > Daniel Hernández BRO IT IS ALL PERSONAL PREFERENCE ... DEPENDS ON YOUR LIKING AND PERSONAL CHOICE OF GAMING...
2020-09-17 03:59:52: well this showcase made us wanna buy PS5 this month

2020-09-17 04:02:07: I sold my PS4 Pro last week (while I could still get a decent price before the market is flooded with PS4's)..... and went back to a standard PS4 (backup spare) while waiting for the new PS5  WOW... I forgot how noisy the fan is on PS4, and the screen refresh reduction, and no HDR, and no 4k upscaling.... really missing my Pro Console now so can't wait for this PS5 Upgrade

2020-09-17 10:50:52: > Fromsoftware's next game is gonna be Elden Ring. After that you can never know if they do a sequel to Bloodborne. As for the remaster they dont need it because they say that ps5 will run ps4 games.

2020-09-17 10:27:41: > @James Bembel Oh you'll see once you play them then come back to this comment and prove me wrong.
2020-09-17 13:49:46: > @James Bembel certainly looks better than that halo infinite problems garbage
2020-09-17 04:28:30: Will buy at the end of its life cycle as all previous ones, for 2-3 exclusives which never come to PC.

2020-09-17 12:18:02: > i can wait for black friday still are lots of ps4 games need to buy
2020-09-18 00:05:18: > We wont be able to buy one it seems. You rather be patient. If there is another lockdown its gonna be more like November 2021.
2020-09-18 08:57:53: > @Lobo ps5 will only be limited so they can get funds to make the other consoles on mass production. Due to corona they have not made much sales due to many stores closing and mainly because money was tight for alot of people. They need to generate cash to produce more consoles to make a overall profit in the end.

2020-09-17 04:43:24: I was starting to get worried I would want to buy every game showed in this Showcase, but Call of Duty came in to save me from spending too much money. Now hopefully the rest of the the showcase is downhill from here, or else my wallet is going to start crying about how empty it's going to be when the PlayStation 5 comes out.
2020-09-17 04:43:52: Thank you so much Sony for the helpful tip that preorders start tomorrow...     SOLD OUT
2020-09-17 04:44:02: this is the HK900 of play stations
2020-09-17 04:44:05: I want FFXVI now!

2020-09-17 13:49:45: > @Anakin Sepherd No
2020-09-17 14:07:53: > I'm tempted to wait for the pro version, it'll be what the ps5 should have launched as
2020-09-17 15:13:34: > Brian Lloyd dont be so sure, every ps4 pro Ive seen is louder than a jet engine, prepare for the worst
2020-09-17 18:13:32: > Brian Lloyd ps5 pro is useless and even if it does come out it aint worth it. The PS5 has everything already.
2020-09-17 18:34:19: > @Shadow Studios that's why we are waiting for the slim lel
2020-09-17 18:34:54: > Oliphant Kid slim is actually a reason since this console is bigger than series x
2020-09-17 18:59:12: > @Shadow Studios idk, the ps5 will barely hit 60fps on most games
2020-09-17 19:20:25: > Brian Lloyd why bother waiting anyway dude i dont care about the quality and graphics anyway i just wanna play playstation exclusives.
2020-09-17 19:38:14: > @Filip Nikitovic I guess I'm lucky, my ps4 pro is very quiet
2020-09-18 13:58:00: > Brian Lloyd nice, stay safe out there man
2020-09-17 04:45:43: I'm loving all the exclusives but I've had bad luck with Playstation in the past sent my ps3 back for repairs 4 times and my ps4 the disc drive broke so I've had to fully download everything when normally I like having discs.
2020-09-17 04:45:51: After 25 years with sony i think its the time to move to the Xbox
2020-09-17 11:53:28: > Another Xbot spotted lying 
2020-09-17 04:46:02: Wouldve been nice to know that preorders started 2 hours after this instead of the 17th like you said.
2020-09-17 04:47:22: I am just freaking Out after seeing miles morales gameplay cant wait to playyy!!!!
2020-09-17 04:47:29: I am not surprised if they are making a new Uncharted game for this Amazing Console.. Uncharted 5 for PS5 Yeah

2020-09-17 04:49:49: thanks Playstation for making my days better and thinking about these games what I loved was the gow ragnarok it really seems to be amazing and I love this franchise
2020-09-17 04:50:03: The exclusive lineup at launch is more disappointing than I expected, might as well upgrade your PC until Sony releases a decent exclusive.
2020-09-17 04:51:21: I' am like "PlayStation" all version
2020-09-17 04:51:27: All Hail PlayStation.
2020-09-17 04:52:39: They did the worst mistake... 450 and 350 would have given a boost to their sale
2020-09-17 06:09:22: > There already selling it at a lost Proboly like a 200 dollar lost for each console
2020-09-17 06:15:03: > @Bryan Rodriguez how?? I mean series x is still powerful but 500 also seems reasonable..if they had to bear lost.. they are gonna boost their sales now cause people will prefer ps5 now
2020-09-17 06:17:11: > @UNIVERSAL YOUTUBER 195 ?
2020-09-17 06:18:21: > @Bryan Rodriguez I mean Xbox is powerful then how ps5 was 700? And also if Sony had to bear some loss still people gonna pay for ps5 for games and make them cover it
2020-09-17 06:19:05: > @UNIVERSAL YOUTUBER 195 Sony can't make it any cheaper they've already planned the price they would try to make it as low as possible
2020-09-17 06:22:17: > @Bryan Rodriguez but still it is quite reasonable and I think ps5 got the best design ever
2020-09-17 06:22:47: > @UNIVERSAL YOUTUBER 195 The price was never officially  revealed at 700 that was rumored
2020-09-17 06:24:42: > @UNIVERSAL YOUTUBER 195 yeah but for every console lossing 100-300 it's going to take awhile to recover
2020-09-17 06:26:14: > @Bryan Rodriguez ohk

2020-09-17 18:46:04: > Aeria Gloris yeah you get to create your own character as well as magic and spells but you have to go to school and learn or wait till all the spells are uploaded on the internet
2020-09-17 19:21:46: > that would make an incredible MMO, shame it's single-player only.

2020-09-17 13:00:14: > SICK!
2020-09-22 17:43:44: > Yea it's $70 for an old game, I'll get both on PC.

2020-09-17 05:02:34: Shame on them they still holding to ps plus it really ruins the experience
2020-09-17 06:08:25: > There selling it at a loss they Proboly lost 200 for every console so ps plus      Helps fund future console
2020-09-17 08:38:15: > @Bryan Rodriguez I know but Microsoft pulled it off why can't they too
2020-09-17 13:20:57: > @Tina Armstrong because Microsoft has way more money then sony

2020-09-17 05:47:32: Why is it more espensive in EU than in US? US citizens make more on average so why do they have cheaper PS5? It costs almost 100 more dollars in EU than in US!

2020-09-17 05:49:44: Sony: Don't worry. We will let you know well in advance when pre orders will go live.   Also Sony: Pre orders will go live tomorrow SEP 17th at select retailers   A few moments later......     PS5 sold out everywhere ‍️
2020-09-17 06:46:55: > I read that some companies are actually doing preorders in advance instead of the actual day they were supposed to.
2020-09-17 07:01:57: > Mugiwara Boy money does push people to break rules so ‍️
2020-09-17 07:22:47: > This reads like a corporate robot trying to blend in.
2020-09-17 07:25:58: > I was able to get an order in at Best Buy about 20 minutes ago
2020-09-17 07:37:24: > got mine last minute from amazon after trying hours on bestbuy & target
2020-09-17 07:39:26: > @Nathan yeah I was almost fed up with BB cuz I had been trying for a few hours with them. Although technically 3AM my time (EST) is midnight of 9/17 PST, so maybe that has something to do with it and why it finally worked about 30 mins ago now? Either way my order is in, so hopefully all will go smoothly
2020-09-17 08:21:32: > A few hundred sold on 16th and today they released more pre order i pre order mines from best buy and it worked
2020-09-17 08:36:27: > i got one ;)
2020-09-17 09:31:19: > i just pre ordered mine :)
2020-09-17 11:20:41: > PS5 preorders  literally sold out everywhere with a hour or less
2020-09-17 11:26:20: > @Tapan Kamila i pre ordered mine 9am this morning uk time
2020-09-17 13:09:07: > I got one from game stop
2020-09-17 13:10:46: > @Jody Barker your digging at people who are unemployed but at the moment thats everybody due to the covid you simply cant make people work if they dont want too but that does not give you any rights to tell people that information because alot of people have lost their previous jobs and even homes due to this pandemic.
2020-09-17 13:14:50: > I got email from Sony (sender is playstation@playstationemail.com) after putting in my online ID on the PS preorder site. It looks legit. It says have to wait till tomorrow (friday) and  at 10am PT you click their link and are put in a waiting room. Then you can order the system and any accesories. Can't share the link or they cut you off, etc. Anybody else do this/get this? I'm wondering if it will take longer to receive the ps5  (shipping times) through them. Doesn't look like much of a choice right now though.
2020-09-17 13:22:11: > @Jody Barker what are you even talking about? Who said anything about being broke?
2020-09-17 13:33:43: > @Jody Barker no you didn't offend me but you must be rather bored to of put that lol
2020-09-17 13:40:12: > @Jody Barker well clearly you haven't got a life then :)

2020-09-17 16:28:22: > I pre order mine 12 clock   im  excited can't wait
2020-09-17 16:44:31: > @Chris C how long did it take you to receive the email
2020-09-17 16:56:33: > @Bryce it says I received it at 1:24am (Gmail). I don't order a lot of stuff in the ps store but I've been on ps plus a long time (on and off). So I guess it's not for the most loyal to ps. I don't understand Sony
2020-09-17 17:56:47: > Nearly everywhere. 
2020-09-17 18:30:03: > @Jody Barker wow and most of us are college students/highschool students doing school at home and hours of homework
2020-09-17 19:15:48: > Gabriella De
2020-09-17 19:45:20: > Stores in the usa have to take some blame as well going early with pre-orders complete fiasco from all involved
2020-09-17 19:47:01: > @Tapan Kamila 10 minutes on amazon uk  lucky I managed to pre-order mine
2020-09-17 20:31:00: > Yeah thats why Im waiting until late 2021 or early to mid 2022, because of that being sold out. Im still enjoying my PS4 slim that I got a few months ago
2020-09-17 21:26:25: > @Jody Barker how old are you
2020-09-17 21:35:41: > I think I will just not buy a ps5 now since sony can't give us the respect were deserve and just save the 2000 I was spending since I can't buy any ps5 I need 3 but f it like sony did to us
2020-09-17 21:38:31: > @Jody Barker really.
2020-09-17 22:46:08: > I really appreciate your great work @Vikehacks on Instagram he is reliable and perfect for any kind of hack job you can reach him on instagram @Vikehacks
2020-09-18 03:41:24: > That was tough. I was lucky to get mine of bestbuy.
2020-09-18 09:36:12: > I pretty missed up
2020-09-18 12:12:01: > @The Doge【ツ】 its because there is blood, gore and jumpscares
2020-09-18 12:13:23: > @Logan Wunder ok, i understand that, but, shouldnt make a more "friendly version"??

2020-09-17 06:09:25: Nice! Hope y'all enjoy this new console, personally I am switching to Xbox since I don't care about Sony exclusives. Have fun people!
2020-09-17 06:09:41: Vergil now official
2020-09-17 06:09:56: Tfd
2020-09-17 06:10:15: Your prices for Europe are literally insulting.
2020-09-17 09:54:44: > Taxes are already in the price itself
2020-09-17 10:20:52: > @shuya א yeah, a base game sold for 79 EUR/93USD is too much anyways. Those also come with DLCS and MTX inside, if not loot boxes.
2020-09-17 06:11:20: *MY BODY IS READY* Come at me!
2020-09-17 06:12:08: loved the whole presentation but when the teaser of GOW hit, the goosebumps started to hit all over)))
2020-09-17 09:02:27: > IKR
2020-09-17 06:12:17: Nothing special...I am looking to that Harry Potter like game.
2020-09-17 06:12:44: I'm broke so I won't be able to get a PS5 anytime soon rip
2020-09-17 06:13:11: That was so weak and poor. Sony are just expecting people to buy the PS5 so why bother trying that includes the console. I will get the series X on launch since I am more excited for the that console as it is a lot more powerful then get the PS5 as a Xmas present hopefully there will be a Spider-Man collector's edition of the console
2020-09-17 06:14:30: They're probably breaking even or making a slight loss on each console, with the sales from ps plus and all exclusive games from sony owned studios to bump up the profits. £449 is a fair price i think
2020-09-17 06:15:20: That Demon Souls gameplay was some weak sauce.
2020-09-17 11:36:15: > Go check you eyes , Xbot
2020-09-17 11:37:30: > @Tapan Kamila It was as weak as your insult.
2020-09-17 14:45:32: > @Maxx Koggen go and watch some Craig Infinite gameplay 
2020-09-18 10:14:38: > Oh no. The fanbois got me. What am I going to do? Life has become meaningless.
2020-09-17 06:15:54: It wont let me watch bc its age restricted.  Like, bruh, Im 14. Probably 50% of the people who will be playing these games are my age or lower.
2020-09-17 06:16:05: sony win guys
2020-09-17 06:16:41: see you guys in 10 years when youtube recommends us this video again. lets compare it in the future
2020-09-17 18:54:07: > Ill see you again, comrade
2020-09-17 19:16:04: > Video got an age redistriction. So no recommendations.
2020-09-17 06:17:06: I am playing FFXV and I am really happy that there is a sequel. GG to SquareEnix

2020-09-17 08:22:22: > I liked it, also cant forget pc players^
2020-09-17 06:19:56: So the Hogwarts game is an RPG. Unironically dream come true.
2020-09-17 09:47:17: > Me la suda soy manolo
2020-09-17 10:03:18: > it´s awesome i´ve been waiting for a game about hogwarts since a long time
2020-09-17 11:37:59: > 
2020-09-17 12:48:34: > They need to make a MMO and stop teasing us
2020-09-17 13:50:04: > I would have bought the PS5 anyways, but this just made my day so much better. I was so excited!
2020-09-17 15:18:31: > Imagine the scenes if that game would have been revealed at E3 or gamescom
2020-09-17 15:49:10: > Black people in England in the late 1800s. Someone is rewriting history...
2020-09-17 16:46:28: > An Owl it's a fantasy world of wizards and magic and ur worried about black people.. just say ur racist and go
2020-09-17 16:59:11: > Finaly its happened
2020-09-17 17:08:49: > @An Owl Its a fantasy world, I hope you do understand what different and imagination means.
2020-09-17 18:34:18: > What is with this fat of people saying unironically? You can just leave that out and it means exactly the same thing.  It's  so hipster to include it.
2020-09-17 21:39:43: > @Ariana Aldana Fantasy world supposedly taking place in the 1800's when black people didn't even have written language or the wheel.
2020-09-17 22:46:42: > I really appreciate your great work @Vikehacks on Instagram he is reliable and perfect for any kind of hack job you can reach him on instagram @Vikehacks

2020-09-17 06:22:32: это разьеб игровой индустрии
2020-09-17 06:22:43: Y is this age restricted
2020-09-17 06:23:40: Xbox Definitely one even though your design is better we have better running graphics and up to 120 FPS and much more you cant possibly defeat Microsoft
2020-09-17 06:24:44: it gave me goose bumbs
2020-09-17 06:25:10: Ok yeah but this was epic
2020-09-17 06:27:27: I have one doubt,doesn't backwards compatibility mean that you can play the games using the old ps4 discs or it is only restricted to ps plus?
2020-09-17 06:28:19: so Reasonable PlayStation Epics forever

2020-09-17 06:38:52: I'm not sad Just disappointed WHERE IS MY ASTROBOT
2020-09-17 06:39:06: A lot of people are going to buy the Digital Edition PS5 only to realize Sony will make them pay full price for a game where your local Walmart will be giving discounts on games a month after release. Smart move on them to make up for that $100 discount.
2020-09-17 06:39:19: they turned final fantasy into the witcher's creed
2020-09-17 09:08:27: > Get over it and don't being such a Spoil.

2020-09-17 06:54:15: To be honest : xbox series x is much better than ps5 if you consider  power and toughness but ps5 has better exclusive games. Im stuck between them i don't know which one i have to buy!! (it's my opinion...)
2020-09-17 09:08:08: > Nobody cares about you.

2020-09-17 11:55:25: > It's only 17% GPU power difference  And teraflops has nothing to do with gaming performance
2020-09-17 11:56:35: > Tapan Kamila Exactly, it irks me when people use teraflops as ammo for which console is better while simultaneously not knowing what a teraflop is or what it does.
2020-09-17 14:40:06: > @Lejend Dairy leave them.. You simply can't argue with a Xbot

2020-09-17 07:23:13: Xbox has left the chat...
2020-09-22 07:18:26: > ...Xbox has rejoined the chat  *microsoft just bought out the publishing rights to Bethesda. Aka the new elders scrolls
2020-09-17 07:24:37: Man, even the NPCs in each game look detailed. Very nice. 
2020-09-17 07:25:14: is mk 11 on ps5
2020-09-17 08:11:41: > Yes through BC
2020-09-17 07:27:07: me before: Yeah I'm gonna wait like two years to get a ps5.  me now: ( . ) _ ( . )
2020-09-17 08:24:09: > YO I DEADASS SAID THE SAMETHING LIKE 2 DAYS AGO, BUT IT WAS A DONE DEAL AFTER THE FINAL FANTASY GAMEPLAY
2020-09-17 09:20:41: > Same here, but I'll likely hold off for a year or two as I have a PC and a Switch to get me through, the PS5 price could get me a new RTX card
2020-09-17 12:26:37: > Same
2020-09-17 13:27:40: > Even the games are too expensive as some of them at $120 Canadian.  That's close to a record high price of $140 (or $230 in 2020 dollars), which belongs to Sega's Phantasy Star IV when it was released in 1995.
2020-09-17 15:14:45: > Me now: Yeah.... I'm gonna wait like 3 years to get a PS6
2020-09-17 20:13:01: > (°-°)
2020-09-17 22:47:04: > I really appreciate your great work @Vikehacks on Instagram he is reliable and perfect for any kind of hack job you can reach him on instagram @Vikehacks
2020-09-18 19:39:46: > @Just watching well you are gonna be waiting longer than 6+ years for that.
2020-09-21 14:28:22: > Same thought
2020-09-17 07:28:17: The worst part of playstation is that you are forced to pay extra 60 every year to have access to the online multiplayer for most games. LIKE I ALREADY PAID 60 FOR THE ENTIRE GAME WHY SHOULD I PAY MORE? I officially rename Playstation 5 to PaymentStation 5 and nickname it as WendingMachine
2020-09-17 09:06:00: > Get over it and don't whine. It's optional and nothing payment extra.
2020-09-17 10:19:34: > @ApeX Gamer95 optional? you cant play multiplayer for most of the games if you dont pay extra
2020-09-17 07:30:32: 6:22 notice the texture on the door before and after the guy passes through Mind boggling 
2020-09-17 09:58:10: > Hitanshu S what is it
2020-09-17 10:04:26: > @Momo lop I think it's a rendering technique instead of just popping in the high rez texture they render it when the door is covered by the NPC
2020-09-17 10:04:41: > @Momo lop it's also used in rdr2 I guess
2020-09-18 05:43:36: > Hitanshu S oh I see that now
2020-09-18 05:43:53: > Hitanshu S thanks
2020-09-17 07:31:41: w8 fro 19 nov

2020-09-17 07:33:19: PS5 showcase: The following is on a PC...
2020-09-17 08:44:19: > Only for 1 game ...
2020-09-17 08:45:16: > @John B the opening game. I haven't had a chance to watch the whole thing yet, either. Work got in the way :(
2020-09-17 09:12:59: > but it emulates the ps5 experience so its what youd see on the ps5 at its peak performance
2020-09-17 09:18:57: > @Sonam Namgyel if that was Xbox doing a showcase, do you not think they'd get hammered for showing a game running on PC?  Just seems a little silly.  "See the power of the next generation!*    Emulated on PC because we still haven't got it up and running on the console that launches soon"
2020-09-17 09:24:18: > @Aaron James they do everything else ran on PS5 it's probably on Square Enix that that trailer was run on a PC
2020-09-17 09:26:50: > @Banjomike97 fair enough. I will watch the rest when I am not working (although I am working currently and shouldn't be adding comments here! XD). I'm up to Black Ops at the moment.
2020-09-17 11:29:51: > This game isn't even close to being ready Probably 2022
2020-09-17 11:42:00: > @Tapan Kamila doesn't really fit the "ps5 showcase" message, though, does it?
2020-09-17 14:44:30: > @Aaron James this is just an announcement trailer and a preview of how the game gonna look Playstation has nothing to do with it.. Ask Squre Enix
2020-09-19 04:28:09: > Shut up Xbot
2020-09-19 13:13:17: > @Mehrad 19 witty. I'll back down.
2020-09-20 08:58:47: > Aaron James but half of Xbox exclusives are on pc
2020-09-20 09:00:08: > @Yes Bruv yeah, but my point isn't about exclusives. It's about a console showcase where a game being shown isn't on the console.
2020-09-20 09:08:40: > Aaron James but it will be
2020-09-22 03:51:39: > @John B the other games are all coming to PC anyway.  I didn't see a single PS5 exclusive that wasn't coming to PC or PS4.
2020-09-22 17:25:39: > @Aaron James At least XBox says games are also available on previous consoles and PC. Sony misleads PS5 only games at event (basically lying), then says *PS4 versions are available on a freaking blogpost.*
2020-09-22 17:39:56: > @P8Z77VLK I'm an Xbox gamer. I've got a Series S and Series X pre-ordered.
2020-09-22 17:40:39: > @P8Z77VLK my profile pic is a project xCloud founding member, too.
2020-09-22 17:55:26: > @Aaron James All I'm saying is what's up with holding back information, just be straight up front with fans.
2020-09-22 18:39:53: > @P8Z77VLK agreed. Misleading sales techniques should be discouraged.
2020-09-17 07:36:47: Fantastic presentation  Very excited  Well done to all those involved  And congratulations
2020-09-17 07:37:22: Why doesn't it have an optical audio port

2020-09-17 15:32:16: > @Saarthak Singhal In Norse mythology, Ragnarök (/ˈræɡnəˌrɒk, ˈrɑːɡ-/ ( listen)) is a series of events, including a great battle, foretold to lead to the death of a number of great figures (including the gods Odin, Thor, Týr, Freyr, Heimdallr, and Loki), natural disasters and the submersion of the world in water.

2020-09-17 15:34:24: > Difference is unfortunately we only get old PS4 games. They get all their new titles. I was hoping for so much more. Oh well. Better than slap to the face.
2020-09-17 18:31:36: > Will these games be free for limited time or forever?
2020-09-17 18:36:36: > What PS plus deal?
2020-09-17 18:54:22: > @Aeria Gloris did you not watch the video? If you have a PS Plus subscription when you buy a PS5 you will get the extra benefit of a selection of some of the best games from PS4 they showed about 15 games. So on top of everything you get with PS Plus sub you'll now be able to download and play some extra games that you may or may not already have played.
2020-09-17 19:42:39: > @Peter Row that's is so cool, I just got one question. Does your ps plus member ship carry on?
2020-09-18 09:50:22: > @The_ BoGy Yes it does, you simply log into your PS5 with the same PSN account and all your cloud saves for PS4 games as well as all the usual benefits and this new  PS plus collection benefit will be there waiting.
2020-09-17 08:24:14: meh..

2020-09-18 10:54:27: > you can't compare ps4 and ps5 specs. you will experience a whole new world. enjoy the ps5 games on your ps4 with 30-40 fps. with slow loading + you are talking like everyone has a high-end computer. they don't. ++ the ps5 controller is also really great. this is not stupid. you are stupid.
2020-09-18 13:21:15: > @Weezel I agree with everything else except the fact that you called the commenter stupid. He's not necessarily stupid, he actually raised a pretty decent opinion.
2020-09-18 14:16:26: > @Uncle Donel then you obviously did not agree with my other points... you are stupid too.. stupid.
2020-09-18 15:49:34: > @Weezel classic playstation supporters...
2020-09-18 16:04:45: > @Weezel mate he has a point and u also do everybody has an opinion his is that and its not stupid and yours for me is right ps5 will have better fps and quality and so much things but no need to call him stupid

2020-09-17 09:12:55: I've been so excited for this for so long but now I'm so deflated. So much current-gen-looking rehashing of existing IP's. I'm so painfully disappointed 
2020-09-17 09:20:22: > You been play games too much and your expectations went too high.

2020-09-17 09:36:08: Gta6???
2020-09-17 09:37:18: Haha, nice try, Sony, but i'm afraid i have something else to do from November 20th forward. The PS5 will have to wait!! Maybe later
2020-09-17 11:33:08: > We all know thats cap

2020-09-17 09:39:42: Ragnarok is coming!
2020-09-17 09:41:31: I'm excited.
2020-09-17 09:42:36: Why didnt sony say pre-orders were open. They said there would be plenty of time to tell people. Also, the fact that everyones getting more details from Geoff Keighley than the actual event is just weird, I dont get it.
2020-09-17 15:39:41: > I think the stores were the ones who opened their preorders too early
2020-09-17 15:44:44: > inyrui I think youre right
2020-09-17 15:50:00: > @inyrui this is  how I have perceived it recently as well.
2020-09-17 16:09:25: > inyrui Yes the stores opened pre orders too soon. But Sony was also too vague and did not give enough notice
2020-09-17 16:29:40: > Kobe very true
2020-09-17 16:30:47: > @Kobe so when do you think sony pre orders will open
2020-09-17 16:44:31: > @SirLaughAlot 07 it says that they made this 2 Months ago so they did not know
2020-09-17 16:44:45: > @Bryce it's open
2020-09-17 16:45:45: > @Chad R. now on playstation website?
2020-09-17 16:46:38: > If it was the stores then Xbox pre orders will "all of the sudden" become available on monday instead of tuesday.
2020-09-17 17:00:56: > That wasn't Sony but retailers sadly.
2020-09-17 17:26:53: > Bryce I dont know. People who signed up for pre order and got selected can order from sony directly tomorrow. I assume the others will get a chance after that
2020-09-17 17:28:30: > I'm pretty sure they're tryna let the hype build some more
2020-09-17 17:29:34: > Ukn0wn_userr Yes thats very possible. Its hard to imagine there wont be a restock
2020-09-17 18:32:16: > They should have limited how many you could order people are ordering both versions when its unfair since some of us can't even preorder at all talking about Sony and retailers cause people on twitter are bragging how they ordered more than one
2020-09-17 22:47:30: > I really appreciate your great work @Vikehacks on Instagram he is reliable and perfect for any kind of hack job you can reach him on instagram @Vikehacks

2020-09-17 09:49:46: RIP Nintendo.. with it's dated ideas and ancient hardware's. xD Sony Playstation is and has been for some years - the future.  Microsoft is also irrelevant now, with Sony's exclusives, there's simply no reason whatsoever to buy an Xbox.
2020-09-17 09:49:54: I love you Sony, but pre-orders are a shitshow.
2020-09-17 09:52:02: A ps5 in my country is gonna cost 10000
2020-09-17 09:52:53: So all the PS4 games on the ps plus collection will be free to download and play if you have PS plus ? @PlayStation
2020-09-17 09:54:40: Ps5 is releasing on my birthday 
2020-09-17 10:00:24: > Congratulations

2020-09-17 09:55:25: Yayyyy
2020-09-17 09:59:40: Most of the games are too speed or extremely hyper unrealistic. I hope Playstation can support conceptual cinematic games. Generally speaking, Playstation is better than Xbox
2020-09-17 10:01:27: At 44:21 they sold me a PS5. 
2020-09-17 10:01:54: There already sold out of pre orders so by the time it comes out in November you won't be able to get one till maybe next year thanks sony

2020-09-17 11:24:33: > Hopefully for Series X/S soon?
2020-09-17 10:02:23: Apex legends will be aviable?
2020-09-17 10:04:24: Not a fan of Bethesda repatching dishonored and spitting it out as another title.
2020-09-17 10:05:04:

2020-09-17 10:13:56: I didnt get the ps5 sadly rip 
2020-09-17 10:14:03: When does pre orders open
2020-09-17 10:14:50: Mostly sequels of game series that I am not interestet in. None of these games spark my interest enough to buy a new console. I'll wait till GTA6, Wolfenstein 3 or the next Elder Scrolls comes out.
2020-09-17 10:16:05: 43:22 is where the prices are thank me later =)

2020-09-17 10:20:15: Genios para cuando el ps plus en ps4 gratis ?  No se hagan los boludes
2020-09-17 10:20:32: Very nice. PS VR 2, got to show that, Sony friends.
2020-09-17 10:21:10: Sony must be happy all the shopbots bought all the preorders. Been trying for 6 hours and not one retailer has preorders. This has to be the worst preorder launch for real people ever. Bots and scalpers win again. Capitalism is getting alot worse.
2020-09-17 11:28:04: > Wait for the launch You will get one
2020-09-17 18:37:03: > What?
2020-09-17 19:00:45: > I received an email from Best Buy when they went live.  Within 4 mins the digital were sold out and 13 mins for disc drive ones.  I managed to get the disc drive one preordered but I only wanted the digital one.  This wasnt what I was expecting when Sony said there will be plenty of notice before preorders
2020-09-18 08:37:04: > Blame Walmart. They started earlier than they were supposed to.
2020-09-19 18:58:32: > What are you saying? Ppl with scalpers would set them at the time Sony were to decide, remember, they said they would tell us the exact timing, so bots would be set that timing. But here, they made it unprecedented so no bots were set cos it came at a minute's notice. Sony really calculated this. Ppl win, not shopbots
2020-09-20 03:29:08: > So will ps5 actually run 4k 60fps like series x
2020-10-18 14:57:22: > Mike Coxlong yes
2020-09-17 10:24:09: I'm going to skip the Fortnite here.

2020-09-17 10:47:00: I realy dont get why this needed an "event" its poor quality stream. nothing realy new or supricing. No gameplay from horizon, nothing from the new look of the menus and/or teardown of the system. THis would have made the same impact or better even if they just released the gameplay trailers on youotube in 4k...

2020-09-17 11:14:58: This is the reward for surviving the 2020
2020-09-17 19:50:51: > :-D yes
2020-09-17 21:43:10: > ah yes, another fnaf game
2020-09-17 21:44:28: > You know this is a downward spiral right? 2021 will be worse and so on. Maybe in 30 or 50 years it'll go up again, if we're lucky.  Also 2020 isn't over yet. We can expect a civil war breaking out at the election in America. That's gonna spread throughout many other countries as well.
2020-09-17 21:50:59: > @BeastVicious I'm pretty sure that should a civil war break out in the US, the rest of the world will shrug in unison. At this point, we don't really care about that country anymore.
2020-09-17 21:59:45: > @Salad Spinner No, becouse it's the same problem in almost all western countries. It's a snowball effect. Like with George Floyd, that didn't remain in America. There were riots, lootings and killings in many other countries as well in the west.
2020-09-17 22:14:38: > @Salad Spinner I get, it the us doesn't really know what they're doing anymore
2020-09-18 06:33:20: > BeastVicious you alright bud?
2020-09-19 15:30:40: > Underated comment 
2020-09-21 02:08:18: > BeastVicious no 2016 to 2020 is the boss wave, after this things will be easier.
2020-09-21 08:45:43: > FAX!!!
2020-09-22 08:29:35: > way better to think of it that way
2020-09-29 23:13:36: > thx bro saved hella time.
2020-09-30 23:19:52: > To me this, COD, Spider-Man and Cyberpunk are the rewards of 2020. And in an unrelated Nintendo note, Crown Tundra DLC and Mario 3D All-Stars
2020-10-02 14:47:06: > Not a reward if we have to pay for it :/

2020-09-17 11:24:56: With this "Final Fantasy XVI" you broke the system. Great trailer. I just have no hope that the game will be with Polish subtitles.
2020-09-22 03:53:03: > we will find out in 2024 when it finally comes out on PC and PS5 and Xbox
2020-09-17 11:27:18: My wallet doesn't like what he see's.

2020-09-17 11:31:39: 349$ and 449$ wouldve been the best price
2020-09-17 13:24:29: > They've already lowered the price because of the xbox
2020-09-17 11:34:39: Next time I wanna Syphon Filter, Tenchu or Silent Hill remake

2020-09-17 11:55:59: What!!!!!!!
2020-09-17 11:56:42: Make more ps5 copies
2020-09-17 11:58:01: Playstation management is immoral.  Management never releases enough Playstations in an effort to create hype. What the console market needs is more competition. I hope with that competition Playstation goes under.
2020-09-17 12:00:40: Yes finally a fnaf trailer
2020-09-17 12:00:47: yes Yes YES  *YES*   *Y E S*   *Y  E  S  !  !*  wait... will Skyrim be on the ps5?
2020-09-17 12:00:56: YEAAAAAAAHHH
2020-09-17 12:01:18: its not a playstation exclusive if it gets a PC release
2020-09-19 19:56:31: > @Twisted Parasite it says playstation console exclusive, but i can get it on PC, since when does that mean its consoles only exclusive, dont try to defend them, they dont deserve it
2020-09-17 12:02:51: Well I guess its time for another  shadow of colossus remake
2020-09-17 12:05:15: Pleasently surprised. Not a huge COD fan, but everything else looked amazing!
2020-09-17 12:06:11: personally I won't be getting Hogwarts legacy until I know for certain that JKR will not be receiving any portion from the sales. Her recent behaviour is dangerous and problematic and should not be endorsed
2020-09-21 17:30:55: > Your dangerous
2020-09-17 12:11:23: awesome cant wait hey peeps check out my bros streaming fortnite every night if yall are bored come say hi

2020-09-17 12:27:13: Some time stamps would be nice Edit: the comment right under mine was about time stamps xD
2020-09-17 12:28:28: Seriously? It's mostly a bunch of PS4 and PS3 games.   Considering the PS5 games also release on PS4, what exactly is there to be hyped about?
2020-09-17 16:20:50: > Most of these won't though? Also ps3 were?
2020-09-17 12:30:48: Someone confirm, I brought Persona 5 Royal digitally on the PS4 in March, is their away to port your PlayStation account to the PS5, then download (in my case) Persona 5 Royal straight from their. Kinda like the save data cloud on switch.

2020-09-17 17:26:27: > Explain
2020-09-17 17:49:34: > @Colin Hart Self explanatory. Did you not watch both the streams. Did you not see with your own eyes? Have you not seen the track records, exclusives,etc. I'm no fanboy. I have always had PS but I always consider the options. I thought about getting both, but the xbox doesn't show anything to my liking. Maybe that hellblade game.
2020-09-17 13:03:08: Can't even imagine how loud the PS5 is gonna be, gonna be sounding like a rocket taking off.
2020-09-17 13:03:57: FF16！
2020-09-17 13:04:58: but why does it cost 500$ and 500?? bc 500$ are actually only 423? i dont understand why europeans have to spend more money on it

2020-09-18 01:36:50: > sony didn't do that, it was the retailers, even walmart told people that they can pre order now instead of listening to playstation's date.
2020-09-18 13:51:28: > Mr CrystalX yea

2020-09-17 13:50:16: Turkey Trabzon mu neeeee :D
2020-09-17 13:50:56: Discrasful preorder launch. 
2020-09-17 13:51:54: i was lucky and got a pre-order, but to many it was crappy sony.  If you stated in the press conference the exact time retailers wouldn't have done what they did.  This is on you. Make it right!
2020-09-17 13:52:12: Waw
2020-09-17 13:54:05: the following content is captured on pc emulating the ps5 experience *we getting ps5 emulator!*

2020-09-17 14:01:57: is game sharing still a thing?
2020-09-17 14:02:07: 44:07 This truly made me bust
2020-09-17 14:03:08: So was the whole pre-order fiasco designed to get me to switch to an xbox? I think it might of worked.
2020-09-17 14:03:26: there are people on ebay with conformed pre-orders selling PS5's for £650. There should be some way of stopping this. Its not right. I'm pretty sure Sony together with ebay could handle it some how.
2020-09-17 14:03:54: I might get it if I get ill get the disc version because you can play all ps4 games on it
2020-09-17 14:05:03: This will be epic
2020-09-17 14:05:38: So y'all gonna make playing online free or just gonna follow Xbox's routine again?
2020-09-17 14:07:59: Porcoddio
2020-09-17 14:10:12: ...im seeing new what looks to be new games in ps4 pro graphics...hard to justify another 500.00 from the pro..
2020-09-17 14:10:38: Demon's Souls is NOT coming to PC, but thr fine print says it is  .. Sony NEEDS TO CLARIFY WHICH GAMES ARE EXCLUSIVE, TIMED EXCLUSIVES, ETC.. ... TOO MUCH WIERD OR BS communication during & after the event .. + missing Infos on backwards compatibility or release dates (Returnal?)
2020-09-17 14:11:21: Fnaf :D
2020-09-17 14:12:32: Some of the games look like last gen
2020-09-17 14:15:15: Please bring back the PS Vita, Sony, please.

2020-09-17 14:22:27: So what does the price of PS5 and Crash bandicoot 4 have in common?      *its about time* 
2020-09-17 14:24:31: As a PS3 player, guys,  do you recommend me to buy the ps5 2 months later the official launch?
2020-09-17 15:10:21: > If you like the games that are released by then or the backwards compatible ones, sure.
2020-09-17 14:25:46: Were the Juan fans
2020-09-17 14:30:18: So no Knack 3  I'm not gonna buy it
2020-09-17 14:31:53: bruh
2020-09-17 14:32:32: if you buy the PS5 disc version, will you still have the option to buy digital games as well? Or you strictly have to buy the digital version?
2020-09-17 14:33:09: Can we play cod today
2020-09-17 14:33:44: DMC4 - PS3 DMC4SE - PS4 DMC5 - PS4 DMC5SE - PS5 Capcom.. we see what you're doing. Pls give local co op like in Nintendo switch. Or at least learn from darksiders genesis..

2020-09-17 15:02:47: > Not at all
2020-09-17 14:39:40: Ps5 games are going to  80 that's equivalent of $94
2020-09-17 14:40:56: im new to playstation and i need help! is the PS5 the only one coming out? or will there be a pro version like what they did with PS4?
2020-09-17 15:04:19: > For now only digital and disc version. Probably in a couple of years a pro version, like with ps4.
2020-09-17 15:07:55: > G O thank youuuuu i appreciate it, i have a Xbox one S, do you think its smart to buy a playstation 5? is there a big difference? ik its different systems but idk what to do :(
2020-09-17 15:21:52: > @Axel the next-gen xbox is a bit more powerful, while the ps5 has better exclusive games (my opinion and many others). If you don't care about the exclusives stay with Xbox.   Not sure if the games you have on xbox are playable on the next gen Xbox but if they are that is a thing to consider too. :)
2020-09-17 14:40:56: Sackboy should Never EVER have a voice.
2020-09-17 14:42:24: BOI
2020-09-17 14:44:44: I screamed when I saw FNAF:security Breach!!!
2020-09-17 17:53:27: > Penny-wise Dancing clown SAME
2020-09-17 20:56:54: > The jumpscare isn't scary at all, I'm kinda dissapointed.
2020-09-17 21:35:54: > @Worm Kiddo well you need to play and experience the game i too don't gat scared from jumpscares in trailers but when i play it, i'll get traumatized.
2020-09-17 22:06:51: > Me too I started shacking
2020-09-17 22:50:04: > Same

2020-09-17 14:48:35: What about the black edition 
2020-09-17 14:48:59: I am definitely getting demon souls the second that i get the chance to.
2020-09-17 14:49:13: I'll get one in 2021 when all the games actually come out.
2020-09-17 14:50:36: Why did they age restrict this ???
2020-09-17 14:51:05: being able to buy digital or even download for free game for ps4 to ps5 does not constitute backwards compatibility. get it right, you have enough money, let us use our old games on the new consoles.
2020-09-17 14:52:34: Deathloop is like if TF2 and valorant had a baby
2020-09-17 14:53:02: Let's hope they get this pre-order stuff figured out. I signed up for emails from Sony, Walmart, target, Amazon, gamestop, and best-buy. The only one who actually emailed me was best-buy and I had it in my cart for hours, but could never check out :(
2020-09-17 17:08:21: > Same, tried to pre-order it from different retailers but they were all sold out :(
2020-09-17 14:53:44: Lets get hyped now bois

2020-09-17 15:36:18: > @Elus Hill XD
2020-09-17 14:54:39: The only thing I cared for on this whole thing was the new FNAF game
2020-09-18 05:52:32: > WOW, What a casual gamer.
2020-09-19 15:29:36: > How Disappointing

2020-09-17 15:14:14: > @Infinity Of Nolan true true but you don't get playstation exclusives
2020-09-17 15:09:14: Sure Black Ops looks nice but why are the guns always dry when its raining.....

2020-09-17 15:23:40: What a joke sony you have become all this hype and only few million units ready all pre orders sold out in uk before websites even refresh another disappointment from you guys 
2020-09-22 17:47:59: > *$70 games....* for new AAA games
2020-09-17 15:23:48: Either Xbox fan or a PS fan. Lets just be thankful that were living in this awesome generation of consoles!
2020-09-17 15:24:40: 44:12 the best moment
2020-09-17 15:25:19: What is the game called at 0:14
2020-09-17 15:25:40: > That space one
2020-09-17 15:26:07: Those things that this is selling 4 million less and there's some problems those things are stupid
2020-09-17 15:26:31: Atleast upload the video quality at 4k  doesn't see those details and quality at 1080p
2020-09-17 15:27:50: AGORA SIM  SONY
2020-09-17 15:29:32: Not really impressed with the game line up.
2020-09-19 19:18:43: > Launch or every game showed so far?
2020-09-17 15:30:19: To wait until 2023 to buy it, so that there are already 3 or 4 of the heavy exclusive titles, and meanwhile, this year to buy Xbox Series X to play the vast majority of the games that are multiplatform, better and cheaper, on top of Game Pass Ultimate, full backward compatibility, etc etc. I had planned to update the PC but what I was going to buy and the performance that I was going to have, I didn't even update it. For 500 dollars I go for an Xbox Series X.
2020-09-17 15:30:58: So this is a PlayStation 5 show case yet everything that was shown was on PC??? Makes perfect sense. Ah had to watch it again just the opening and new ff were not shown using ps5 got it.
2020-09-17 15:31:24: 35:35 GOBLIN SLAYER 
2020-09-17 15:31:25: the movements in Black obs Cold war looks like best Movements of every Call of Duty

2020-09-17 15:35:13: Shitstorm over Sony
2020-09-17 15:38:31: Jesper que les manette seront plus solide
2020-09-17 15:39:28: Me:Send one to my home    Sony:Fk off
2020-09-17 15:40:09: Games will cost $70 in the US and $95 in Europe! The console itself costs $90 more in Europe! Europeans being screwed over as usual.
2020-09-17 15:41:03: it looks like PS4. Very underwhelming graphics.
2020-09-17 16:11:54: > It's the start of it's life time that's how it works plus demon souls does not look like any ps4 game i have seen
2020-09-17 20:54:49: > @Prip I'm just saying, ps3-ps4 there was a big difference at launch. PS5 doesnt look anything special, graphics wise.
2020-09-17 15:41:26: The hype of gow and the voice of kratos literally gave me goosebumps in the hair of my arms and mh chest !!
2020-10-02 22:36:40: > Why?
2020-09-17 15:44:00: Is it just me or did anyone else heart stopped when while you were watching this stream while chatting with your friends, and then you hear "THE TIME COMES NEAR", and then your eyes are so big looking at the screen and your mom says "What happened!?!?"....
2020-09-17 15:44:45: As an xbox player. Im hyped for theses games
2020-09-17 15:45:40: Those who can't afford ps5 are waiting for radbrad to play all games!! Hit like if you agree
2020-09-17 15:48:11: Should have been optional to play as the real Spiderman or that value-brand imposter in the trailer...
2020-09-17 15:48:41: RIP PS5
2020-09-17 15:53:25: I love PLAYSTATION 
2020-09-17 16:09:52: > SAME! Personally I think that most of these games look amazing(even though I'll probably just buy like 2 or three of them). Which one are you most excited for?
2020-09-17 15:53:30: Ps5 is truly gonna be wayy better than xbox im sure
2020-09-17 15:54:03: It was about game

2020-09-18 10:57:31: > Temtem. Pokemon like mmorpg.
2020-09-18 21:37:55: > @Hurley ok, thank you!

2020-09-17 16:16:11: What happened to giving us plenty of time so we all had a chance to pre order? How long until you make more consoles? Feels like my Christmas is ruined now! If xbox can make more consoles I can see the selling more

2020-09-17 17:11:44: 499$???       OVER PRICED!!!
2020-09-17 17:15:34: Woods is back
2020-09-17 17:16:23: Can someone tell about about these ps5 free game upgrades likehow does it work with disk ps4 games and hpw can i get it
2020-09-17 17:18:54: I was able to pre-order 5 minutes before midnight on the Best Buy website. It had said coming soon for most of the night, I randomly refreshed and it allowed me to add to cart and I checked out with PayPal, I even pre-ordered the headset. It says its being shipped on the  Nov 12th. Not sure if I got lucky or its some sort of glitch. It says Coming Soon now
2020-09-17 17:20:56: Now, my big question is: Why should I get it in November 2020, when all these AAA-title release next year, and no (or maybe just a few) informations about PS4-PS5-Upgrades have been published?!?!? Actually I'm looking forward to play CP2077, and replay Death Stranding, RDR2... but only if upgraded.
2020-09-17 18:54:13: > They said that at least cp2077 players would get an upgrade I believe. Pretty sure its handled on a case by case basis
2020-09-19 19:17:36: > You don't need to upgrade right away unless a exclusive ps5 game interests you. For me Demons Souls it's that game and the possibility of better graphics with more details on spider-man Miles Morales.
2020-09-17 17:21:03: I want a It just Works: Tribute to Todd Howard game....not cool Sony
2020-09-17 17:25:10: Am I the only one who would go crazy for a Marvel Venom Game looking like that Spiderman Game? 
2020-09-21 11:49:16: > Your not the only one
2020-09-21 12:10:24: > @Hoodie It would be like combining that Hulk Game and the Spiderman Game into one badass Game! 
2020-09-21 12:22:09: > @Christin Eleven  yeah it can be a hack and slash and a platformer
2020-09-21 12:50:59: > @Hoodie Kind of like smashing (or voring) opponents, throwing cars around, destroying things AND climbing and jumping around on skyscrapers! 
2020-09-21 13:40:56: > @Christin Eleven yeah that would be cool
2020-10-08 18:32:01: > Yeah its not happening
2020-10-08 18:32:05: > Stop
2020-10-08 18:47:12: > @Gamerboii 86 Never! 
2020-09-17 17:25:28: does anyone know if the HDMI cable that comes with the console is a 2.1
2020-09-17 17:28:18: > I think so

2020-09-17 18:28:10: Hi
2020-09-17 18:30:52: You will forever be known as the game that came after the dmc5 special edition trailer
2020-09-17 18:35:37: Hello
2020-09-17 18:38:56: Hello
2020-09-17 18:42:14: Why don't they just run the games on the PS5 instead of emulating them on pc? Really makes me think that the console isn't as powerful as it seems. This is a really poor marketing strategy.
2020-09-17 21:15:41: > And people bashed the xbox series x for running their games on pc and also being available on pc lol it's a bit hypocritical of them now lol
2020-09-17 22:40:58: > @I GoLD GinGY090 I No they didn't, link a video that they did to me
2020-09-18 06:40:18: > @The Joker the ps5 new showcase at the start it said we're gonna emulated these games on pc unless u don't have eyes
2020-09-17 18:46:38: See you in 2027 during the time of PS6 release !
2020-09-17 18:48:06: I'll buy it in 2-3 years (as I did with every other playstation generation), maybe there will be a pro variant. Mostly, I'll hope that the pro will have a different design. This one is so horrible, it looks like some retrofuture idea created decades ago. Impractical shape. I slapped my ps4 pro on a wall, hidden behind the tv, even thou this console looks great. I don't want visual clutter. There is just tv on my wall, no shelfs, everything is hidden behind the tv. I'll probably have to find a DIY method of fixing this hideous monstrosity to a wall.
2020-09-17 21:25:57: > Get over it and don't being such a Spoil.
2020-09-18 05:08:27: > @ApeX Gamer95 I'll buy it in the future, but I won't get moved the ugly design.
2020-09-17 18:49:00: can i get one in black?
2020-09-17 18:55:35: Much as I want one, if I can't get one at launch so be it. It's still better than XBox - now confirmed cheaper and even more better games, :)
2020-09-17 18:56:29: and thank you for Fnaf on PS5
2020-09-17 18:58:00: It should be called PlayStation 4.9
2020-09-17 21:25:42: > Nobody cares about you.
2020-09-17 18:59:38: nobody talking about DMC5 SE LITERALLY BEING ANNOUNCED LIKE !!!!!
2020-09-17 18:59:58: Hopefully game downloads speeds will increase when launching a digital only console. Download of BO alpha takes hours.  Pre order done!
2020-09-17 19:00:26: EXCLUSIVE BUT NOT REALLY THO JUST KINDA LIKE ITS ON PC
2020-09-17 19:01:41: 11:09   SpiderMan: Dont worry! I got you.  *Spears bus driver through glass window*
2020-09-17 19:02:53: Sony: heres some boring random stuff. PlayStation fans: Why would we buy  this trash??.
2020-09-17 21:23:48: > Nobody cares about you. No wonder you like your own comment.

2020-09-17 19:16:36: PS5's library looks solid!
2020-09-17 19:17:17: I think it's a quite ridiculous line up showcase where Square showed their Final Fantasy XVI where the intro said "The following content is captured on PC emulating the PS5 experience". And closed with "Playstation console exclusive" with small notes said "Also available on PC". I mean, why would they put it like that?
2020-09-17 19:22:31: > it might be cause it'll be only be on pc and ps5?
2020-09-17 19:19:09: Im just leaving a comment so people in the future can see that I was an part of this war

2020-09-17 19:34:55: My question is....            *does it come in black*
2020-09-17 19:41:45: More ps5 to europe 
2020-09-17 19:44:06: You should cancel Walmart amazon usa best buy game stop who went early & hold on to there allocation of ps5 & give them to a store who waited until the 17th at 9am for pre-orders to go live
2020-09-17 19:45:29: Wait! So why does Xbox exist??
2020-09-17 19:46:32: I loved the Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets game on PS2 - and I can't wait for this Hogwarts game now too

2020-09-18 01:47:56: > Until unreal engine 5 is released for every developer next year then it'll jump again. But it'll take em a few years to optimize it. So about 2023 can expect new jump realistically.
2020-09-18 16:22:05: > I hope we can se LESS realistic games in the future. I´m tired of "realism"
2020-09-18 19:57:20: > @kenshin himura ii hear that. Not every game needs to look like a lifetime documentary
2020-09-19 01:55:06: > @kenshin himura I'm a fan of realism however I'm a bigger fan of surrealism so I understand the notion. However I've been waiting for the day graphics would be indistinguishable from life.

2020-09-18 02:14:50: Hey Sony! Yall should make a new Lord of The Rings game!
2020-09-18 04:00:08: > No, Ask Warner Bros for that. And Middle-Earth Game you mean.

2020-09-18 07:58:05: Click for free Netflix link Click for free Netflix link
2020-09-18 08:13:28: at the beginning it says the following content is captured on pc well if it is captured on pc why don't we get a pc instead of ps5 it's much better and we don't need to pay to play online we don't pay for ps plus at all. Well if it is emulating then I could go to google find a gaming pc that's much cheaper than the ps5s pre-order and speculation price  (500$) so basically, we will lose-lose if we buy the ps5. But if we buy the pc then it's a win-win it's better it is much faster and has more features everybody that sees this comment know that I don't hate sony yes a little bit because of overheating on ps4 but still listen to me I'm saving you money by buying a gaming pc or a gaming laptop if you agree with me like if you don't then reply why you don't agree
2020-09-18 09:43:15: > It's normally because pcs cost way more than consoles and much of a console's fanbase is below 18 which means they have no idea how constructing a pc works, plus there are great ps5 games that you can't play on pc so its ps5 + pc
2020-09-18 08:23:49: Game of thrones couldn't be much better. Ugh.
2020-09-18 08:31:23: Playstation makes games feel special to us players Like if you are a PlayStation fan

2020-09-19 01:50:49: > Only thing that was bad is that their wasn't a new knack game.
2020-09-18 12:25:55: Xbox is better yall just saying PlayStation better because of the exclusives a game and a console are too different things
2020-09-18 17:08:53: > Ignore the idiot above me. PlayStations exclusives are in direct relation to the console. They are two different things but that literally means nothing.
2020-09-18 17:20:51: > ApeX Gamer95 people do care dummy
2020-09-18 17:32:07: > @Jahson Jenkins more like bots cares about you.

2020-09-18 12:40:57: Why is this age restricted
2020-09-18 12:44:59: > Because they showed some games kids shouldn't be playing. Though it didn't stop parents from buying there 8 year olds the new Call of Duty.

2020-09-18 13:52:56: And then I find out you decided to not make it backwards compatible. Guess it's time to switch to PC fully. When will you learn?
2020-09-18 14:03:43: Is there gonna be a black ps5 looking and better ps5 like the ps4 and ps4 pro is there gonna be ps5 pro or something else.
2020-09-18 14:06:50: When a Hogswarts game looks & sounds more better than a Harry Potter game. That's when you know we're sick of Harry Potter.
2020-09-20 22:10:52: > Im honestly so excited to go around making spells with my cousin in that game (if its multiplayer)
2020-09-21 15:02:51: > PandaHeroCommunity what? You do realise that hogwarts = harry potter? Hogwarts legacy is a harry potter game lol
2020-09-21 15:25:04: > @WingS he means that there are separate characters of everyone so everyone is unique.
2020-09-18 14:09:01: The Hype for the Harry Potter game just fell off once I saw Avalanche is making the game.  When is the last time they made a game that wasnt below average?
2020-09-18 16:30:22: > Get over it and don't being such a Spoil.

2020-09-18 16:06:12: Fnaf security breach
2020-09-18 16:09:33: It's kind of sad that we've reached a point where huge graphical leaps aren't possible anymore. At the same time though that maybe what's driving developers to be more creative and experiment in other facets of game development.
2020-09-18 16:31:39: > Get over it and don't being greedy.
2020-09-18 16:12:06: I am sold I'm getting it and a few of those games too....

2020-09-18 18:07:15: Io
2020-09-18 18:11:23: Los q quieren q saquen Uncharted  6 ⬇️⬇️
2020-09-18 18:16:25: Just ordered mine from PS link they sent me! Clicked on link at 1pm est and it took about 35 minutes of waiting. As soon as I put in my cc info it said they were out of stock on 1 item and to remove it from the cart. I almost lost it!. But, it was Demon souls
2020-09-18 18:25:23: I got my 4 and I love that ugh this is tempting!
2020-09-18 18:28:11: Im switching from Xbox to ps5 mainly so I can play more games with my friends and for the spider man game!
2020-09-18 18:58:07: Can we talk about how China is the only one not part of the Rest of the World date as shown in the fine print? lol
2020-09-18 19:06:00: Final Fantasy XVI release date  : 2030
2020-09-18 19:17:31: I was actually rather excited about the PS5 until I found out that PS1/2/3 wouldn't be playable from the original disks. Unfortunately that was the entire reason why I was thinking of even getting one, for that backwards compatibility.  Now that it's not there it's lost it's appeal.
2020-09-19 14:09:22: > They will probably add it in with  playstation now or classics
2020-09-19 22:48:20: > @Josiah Blackburn Would still be nice to pop in original disks and play.  It's just frustrating that the only way I have to play games from that era is either emulation or get some expensive adapters to make it look half decent.  At least for PS1/PS2.
2020-09-18 19:18:50: PS500$
2020-09-18 19:23:34: peepee
2020-09-18 19:37:48: Ok well time to buy both the consoles this time around. Once I finish the backlog of games for my Xbox one.
2020-09-18 19:45:49: Thank you to all at PlayStation for making this amazing hardware and  Best graphics going
2020-09-18 19:49:09: Only on thing to say: November 12th, I'll be waiting...
2020-09-18 19:59:58: My PS4 is always glitching may u help me Sony please
2020-09-18 20:12:12: RIP Xbox.
2020-09-18 20:31:28: Brilliant, but same cant be said with the mess of pre orders, very disappointing
2020-09-18 21:17:04: not bad
2020-09-18 21:17:55: Eveyone: wow ps5 is OP Me: ehhhh... PC still king
2020-09-19 00:36:15: > Yeah it's 3 times more expensive
2020-09-19 01:44:41: > Ahem Pc is not a console.
2020-09-19 02:06:58: > @BackPorch B what is your definition of console?
2020-09-19 05:12:59: > @ApeX Gamer95 hater
2020-09-19 05:21:45: > @MrRednexus Nobody cares.
2020-09-19 05:27:40: > @ApeX Gamer95 you sure do
2020-09-18 21:25:15: SONY SONY SONY ....
2020-09-18 21:32:50: Why is it all 30FPS. That's garbage.
2020-09-19 03:52:31: > Get over it and don't being such a Greedy Spoil.
2020-09-19 04:34:01: > I think its way more than 30 frames
2020-09-18 21:34:40: Ok 825 Gigabytes Isnt enough storage considering that Call of Duty is 200 gigs and Destiny 2 is 200 gigs and those are just two games I have. Im going to need more SSD storage and not a lame hard drive.
2020-09-18 21:35:54: Thanks for not putting turkish
2020-09-18 21:40:34: This is the least hype a FF has ever gotten me. I'll be looking for more, but it looks like a FFXIV skin for for FFXV. Was that not Aranea's signature move frame for frame?   That said, the setting could be interesting. A departure from reality based and Futuristic/ Post Futuristic is neat. A more tactics-esque high fantasy setting has been out of the main series for a long time.
2020-09-21 03:06:36: > Agreed, looks like FF XVI is like 14... honestly speaking i do not see the technical jump from the ps4
2020-09-18 21:47:29: A 80euros LE jeu! Est ce que les DLC seront compris? Lol....
2020-09-18 21:59:44: > Et pour un jeu, collector en édition limitée ( dont certains se vendent déjà plus de 200 euros sur ps4  ( prix de sortie)  ).  je devrais payé combien ??? Le prix d'une ps4 ?! C'est ça ?
2020-09-18 22:01:25: MEH!
2020-09-19 03:52:02: > Nobody cares about how you got yourself spoiled.
2020-09-19 14:24:06: > @ApeX Gamer95  Quit  Being judgemental
2020-09-19 20:24:34: > ​@ApeX Gamer95 This showcase disappointed me. Underwhelming/10
2020-09-18 22:04:07: Thank you for this!
2020-09-18 22:14:37: Great showcase, awesome games!
2020-09-18 22:40:14: Sony if you Read this, Please bring back the games from PS3 and the PS4 that are called Modern Warfare (the Modern Warfare Franchise that has all MW games)

2020-09-21 04:38:08: > Yo why is the digital one is less money then the normal one, eh I guess I'll take the 499.99$

2020-09-22 03:37:17: > Sorry, Sony. Microsoft just bought Bethesda.
2020-09-19 13:21:54: The best showcase ever in gaming history! PlayStation is the GOAT no debate.

2020-09-19 14:53:05: How is there no ads
2020-09-19 15:02:06: I don't think the graphics are that much different from the ps4 
2020-09-19 23:08:58: > You been play games too much.
2020-09-19 15:08:55: I really loved that mile morales gameplay but gosh Miles does such a great job of showing the chaos of an unexpected situation and how Spider-Man has to deal everything with only seconds to spare. I couldnt help but smile when I saw him pull the two pieces of the bridge close together. Peter trained him well
2020-09-19 15:14:05: Doidera
2020-09-19 15:15:10: Sony please dont act like apple.

2020-09-19 16:17:10: Parent: the PS5 is so cheap, i thought it would be cost more than 600$ but what did we see, a 400$ Me:So, PS5 succeded with the balance between price and quality. Parent:yes, it would make a perfect present to our children's birthday or christmas.
2020-09-19 16:19:16: claim your "i was here before 1 milion like" ticket here  price 1 like
2020-09-19 16:47:09: Timestamps: 1:13 *BEST MEME OF 2020 SO FAR*         Oh sorry, were you looking for an actual timestamp? Sorry im here just to timeloop this beautiful and underrated sentence: *"The following content is captured on Pc emulating the ps5 experience"* *i know its only final fantasy but i still find it funny
2020-09-19 20:05:07: > It was only for final fantasy
2020-09-20 00:06:10: > 5:32  Only one game that was shown on a PC
2020-09-19 16:49:52: Havent bought a physical console game since MGS 4 and physical PC game since before HL 2  the last 15 games on PS3 that I bought and all 47 games on PS4  all digital  so $399 it is 
2020-09-22 00:58:49: > I have all the games on the playstation store, on my account (I don't have any discs) will be account able to switch from ps4 to ps5
2020-09-22 03:24:21: > 1985 yeah   and maybe should play better too (like the old Boost mode)
2020-09-22 17:22:27: > @Trevor Philips *No improvements* on PS4 games like HDR, or higher FPS. You may only see more stable FPS performance, but don't get hyped for additional benefits.   PlayStation has poor backwards-compatibility.
2020-09-22 17:45:43: > *$70 games....*
2020-09-22 19:02:10: > P8Z77VLK dunno ‍️ official Sony blog says backward compatible titles will run at a boosted frequency on PS5 so that they can benefit from higher or more stable frame rates and potentially higher resolutions. latter is likely case by case but maybe itll apply to guaranteed support they want for the 100 most popular games at launch.
2020-09-23 01:15:03: > Poor investment
2020-09-23 03:23:46: > Pooter123 I have old versions of everything from original SFC versions of Tactics Ogre and Front Mission to basically everyone RPG on the PS1  they are _all_ terrible investments lol   but saving $100 for something I dont need? now thats stonks 
2020-09-19 16:49:56: People here literally complain about not enough exclusives where the console is going to release soon. Relax people, the developers themselves also wants to to test the system on what is capable of. I believe ps4 exclusives several years ago  doesn't have much but now, look at it. It has more exclusives then you expect LOL
2020-09-19 17:18:11: 851 dolar in chile , u mad sony!!!
2020-09-19 17:46:26: Sony got all the shows spot on but the pre order mess up has really tainted things!  EBay should never allow pre orders to appear on their site for 6K etc!

2020-09-19 21:22:30: Wow the new Spider-Man game blew my mind 
2020-09-22 17:48:50: > *Also available on PS4,* Sony just didn't announce it at the event to sell more PS5's
2020-09-19 21:51:35: demon's souls,  was the only nice game. the other are not next gen ones.  FF XVI ... wow... what a visual failure. very disappointed!!! I hope the final games will be far away better. :(
2020-09-20 05:28:51: > That's how you got yourself spoiled like a Casual.
2020-09-19 21:55:27: 13:16 44:20  
2020-09-19 22:21:07: Just a suggestion re backward compatibility for $499.00 PS5, create an emulator for PS3 (with PS2 compatibility) and sell for ~$70. This would be a bestseller for many PlayStation gamers!
2020-09-19 22:46:06: Five nights at Freddy looks pog

2020-09-19 23:28:14: Let Alienware design the PS5 Pro, because Alien Technology is superior, Alienware designs are aesthetically pleasing, and the brand is premium, as it should with that name. Next selling point.. when asked, "But can it run Crysis?" Max settings at 120+ FPS... Casually. Make it happen.
2020-09-20 06:32:20: > No. Get over it.
2020-09-19 23:31:34: Thanks for this clip
2020-09-20 00:29:34: Will the ps4 controller be able to connect with it?
2020-09-20 00:31:41: I saw people already pre-order it long before and make booking to retailers that's not fair there are lots of waiting lists in near retailers even they said I might have to wait next year, what is this.. That's not fair
2020-09-20 00:57:28: Woaaaaaow i want this console
2020-09-20 02:03:17: And where are any editions for Playstation 5 games? As if you are going to publish only ordinary boxes of games without steelbooks or collector's editions, forget that I would support you by buying the game in an ordinary box at full price. I hope that there will be a collector or edition with a steelbook for Demons Souls, Spiderman and Sackboy until the release. Otherwise, I'll wait for discounts and I'll buy those games for a maximum of 10 euros in discounts. I don't buy ordinary game boxes for the full price.
2020-09-20 02:18:34: *_PRICES_* 43:18

2020-09-20 19:47:58: Sony, please add backwards compatibility for the PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5 and carry it on. Backwards compatibility is your only draw back. No one cares about the power. You got the crown for the game for consoles, even if one Xbox is cheaper than the digital PlayStation 5, and even you have the better games than Microsoft.
2020-09-21 02:46:40: > Ps5 and ps4 support backward compatibility
2020-09-20 20:35:57: Yeah yeah yeah cinematics are cool, show us game play.

2020-09-21 22:24:01: Let's face it guys this is really about you and me getting Playstation 5's. "The others are simply there to get us inside those doors."
2020-09-22 00:27:56: Ps5 time bois
2020-09-22 02:06:29: This is Sony, backyard business, without fairplay and without shame. And it does not respect even its consumers, as many are fans of Bethesda games and want to know the news of these games, which are multiplatform and are on PS tb. But Sony prefers to boycott these games and their consumers. It is what this attitude shows. While Microsoft praises Sony at specific times, for the competition's fairplay, it only nudges it when it can. Who remembers the phrase from the beginning of the generation about "resolution makes you a better player", the video about gaming loans, a policy that Sony skipped after seeing the negative reception? You recently spoke badly about XSS. It is always like that, a business thing that is not guaranteed and needs to be based on the "mistakes" of others or make non-constructive criticisms.
2020-09-22 05:33:44: > More like that's your problem.
2020-09-23 04:52:49: > ApeX Gamer95 gee somebody is moody today, huh?

2020-09-22 22:46:48: > @ApeX Gamer95 any game or selected games?
2020-09-23 01:09:43: > @just Q Sony said 99% of PS4 library will be supported. I guess that 1% has weird compatibility issues but eitherway thousands of PS4 games should work fine.
2020-09-23 01:22:44: > @Cutter Elf download or disk?? Or  both??
2020-09-23 01:25:08: > @just Q Both but you obviously need to buy the PS5 disc version for physical backwards compatibility.

2020-09-30 18:22:09: This console as a whole looks sweet man
2020-09-30 19:12:35: people seem to fear the concept that their favorite characters in games and movies are not permanent so i assume they are replacing that emotion with anger and hate.  in fact most gamers are so afraid of consequence that they presume that they think deserve respect from everything and everyone for their fragile opinions, and in some ways even non gamers in the world have that delusion.  they have built a massive mirage masking reality with a consequence free fabrication.  they live in their safe worlds alone in most cases, and hating themselves and if their fiction doesnt cover reality up, they begin to hate them all.. its basically fans having fans that think they make everything and nothing at the same time, so they whine this"its not the way i wanted it to be made", "whaaaaaa".  i guess a lot of spoiled gamers in this modern age have been brought up wrong and just dont know better....
2020-09-30 22:22:28: But can I transfer everything from every Playstation to this one?
