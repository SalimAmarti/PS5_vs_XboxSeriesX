2020-07-23 17:00:08: More trailers!  Yay?
2020-07-24 02:22:40: > The vast majority of which featured gameplay.

2020-07-23 17:00:14: One of the first comment
2020-07-23 17:00:15: EXCELLENT
2020-07-23 17:00:18: Halo looks amazing.
2020-07-23 17:14:45: > It has Xbox 360 graphics. But sure 
2020-07-23 17:16:46: > Brandon Dobbs looking for attention huh?
2020-07-23 17:33:41: > Brandon Dobbs it really does bro
2020-07-23 17:53:48: > Brandon Dobbs it stay better than those movies called games of ps
2020-07-23 20:34:44: > Honestly watching the trailer made me wanna replay Halo 2
2020-07-24 03:13:46: > @Anthony Sanderson He needs to gouge his eyes out if he thinks that looks anything close to 360 graphics. Maybe something like Bugsnax would be more up his alley with its PS2 era visuals?
2020-07-24 03:16:35: > docc19 agreed bro.
2020-07-23 17:00:23: Xbox Takes The W
2020-07-23 17:00:24: Let's go fable

2020-07-23 17:03:37: > idk
2020-07-23 17:00:48: FABLE? Fable what? Fable 4? Fable remake?
2020-07-23 17:01:10: > Most likely Fable 4, cant wait!
2020-07-23 17:01:47: > Reboot
2020-07-23 17:01:50: > Fable

2020-07-23 18:37:59: > probably reboot since they closed lionhead the original creators, though some of their staff may have went to playground.
2020-07-23 19:49:01: > probably fable 2025
2020-07-23 17:01:04: 微软拉了
2020-07-23 17:01:05: Forza and Fable :)
2020-07-23 17:23:07: > Exactly!  Best games of the show.
2020-07-23 17:01:06: Just amazing
2020-07-23 17:01:07: Well that was really disappointing. The ps5 event wins for sure
2020-07-23 17:03:12: > Wins what?
2020-07-23 17:04:44: > @Luke Paule wins second place.
2020-07-23 17:08:02: > @Alvaro Darker wins first place
2020-07-23 17:01:12:  Like For Xbox  Comment For Ps5

2020-07-23 17:01:55: anyone elses feed get taken up by chiefs helmet?
2020-07-23 17:25:17: > Nah.
2020-07-23 17:01:55: Man Xbox, I just sat through this whole thing on twitch and your exclusives have just gone downhill. All these games just look so uninspired and bland. Halo Infinite game play was extremely bland - it looked like it wanted to be DOOM but didn't know how. These exclusives were just meh.
2020-07-23 17:26:15: > They shot themselves in the foot with this show imo
2020-07-23 17:32:49: > Halo infinite was literally 360 graphics
2020-07-23 17:38:04: > If you dont like this halo gameplay you never liked the originals its not for you
2020-07-23 17:45:01: > Some Guy it looks so cartoony though. The originals had this gritty tone that 343 has just forgotten about over time
2020-07-23 17:46:58: > Glctc Thnkr what are you talking about? The grittiest ones were 4 and 5 and people hated them.
2020-07-23 17:59:26: > Some Guy he doesnt know what hes talking about and it shows lmao
2020-07-23 18:33:32: > Some Guy right?? lol this mans high.
2020-07-23 19:06:21: > Gotta agree with you on this one man. Watched it an hour after it went live and was frustrated I'd overslept at first... now I'm glad, watching this live would've been even more disappointing.
2020-07-24 02:34:43: > @ravenburrd You need to go back and look at some 360 games, really study them because 360 could never hope to have something that looks like that. What specifically bad besides the minor pop in in that one elevator part? The grass looked super realistic, GoT levels of realism, the lighting and shadows from the Warthog jumping and landing in the puddle looked amazing.
2020-07-24 02:35:13: > @Glctc Thnkr How? It looks exactly like Halo 1 but with better visuals.
2020-07-24 02:48:04: > docc19 look at the halo 3 and halo reach ar designs and then look at the infinite one. It looks like plastic
2020-07-23 17:02:02: 
2020-07-23 17:02:05: This was brilliant. So psyched for Psychonauts 2!
2020-07-23 17:02:14: Im really interesting in crossfire x, but I was kinda disappointed because we didn't saw, cuphead, KILLER INSTINCT, elden ring, banjo, conker, forza gameplay, or hellblade 2 gameplay, but I'm really waiting for these game you have shown to us, thnxx
2020-07-23 17:25:02: > it's actually elden ring tho
2020-07-23 17:32:35: > They are going to show more games later and probably more gameplay
2020-07-23 17:35:15: > See
2020-07-23 17:45:09: > There will be more showcases later with these games and other
2020-07-23 18:18:01: > @Mrbossman384 They better.
2020-07-23 19:26:05: > @Ni Switch don't give me hope
2020-07-23 20:17:48: > Yikes - big yawn.
2020-07-23 20:41:31: > Np feel free to buy it because it won't be in game pass :)
2020-07-23 21:55:24: > Why would they show elden ring?
2020-07-24 00:28:07: > Banyo? You mean Banjo-Kazooie?
2020-07-24 01:12:49: > @Mrbossman384 when?
2020-07-24 02:59:52: > @d3arb0rns August
2020-07-24 03:50:13: > @Some Guy because FROMSOFT actually likes MS and the game was first revealed by them...
2020-07-23 17:02:23: world premiere

2020-07-23 17:02:29: 
2020-07-23 18:20:20: > 
2020-07-23 17:02:34: Nothing really interested me enough to switch back to xbox
2020-07-24 03:28:11: > Why switch to one or the other? Just own both and then you don't miss out on anything
2020-07-24 08:19:44: > @docc19 Its simple. I cant afford both of them.
2020-07-23 17:02:36: 
2020-07-23 17:02:41: Definitely I'll buy my xsx *-*

2020-07-23 17:31:41: > 
2020-07-23 17:37:44: > @Gonzalo Villa cause your actually playing it. We are watching someone play it. On higher fps. You can't really compare
2020-07-23 17:39:16: > Those pop in textures in the background ‍️

2020-07-24 02:43:23: > @Politically Correct Because it doesnt feel like Halo. There was never sprinting in Halo until they added it in Reach.

2020-07-23 17:05:04: Disappointed...
2020-07-23 17:05:11: honestly I'm just disappointed. you guys hyped this too much and turned out to be meh
2020-07-23 22:23:39: > It's Xbox, that's why they do now and have done since the Xbox One came out.
2020-07-23 17:05:43: Smash like botton for more videos

2020-07-23 17:07:28: Meh
2020-07-23 18:40:42: > Sorry they didnt announce rocket league, scrub
2020-07-23 17:07:32: They hyped it up so much to be meh
2020-07-23 17:07:34: i guess i'm just gonna upgrade my graphic card, from what i ve seen with the show it s not worth buying the console
2020-07-23 17:12:47: > Ok
2020-07-23 17:21:09: > JustChizzin well He said it wasnt worth buying the console, nothing else

2020-07-23 17:47:57: > JustChizzin are you stupid he said console not the games
2020-07-23 18:11:20: > Most of the games are on pc anyways, I probably won't buy the console until I see how Halo Infinite plays out, same for ps5's new Demon's Souls and Ghostwire
2020-07-23 18:44:12: > It wasnt gonna be worth it anyway because Microsoft always brings their exclusives to pc
2020-07-23 17:07:35: Acho que eu nunca vi um trailer tão bom quanto esse. Só vem Halo Infinite!!
2020-07-23 17:07:57: ok halo looks ten time better now
2020-07-23 17:08:04: ゲームプレイ映像がなかったのは残念。 正直期待外れだったけど、ストーカー2やいくつか面白そうなゲームはあった。  日本語の翻訳ライブでする必要あったか？事前に翻訳か字幕入れとくべき。 日本市場軽視してるって言われても仕方ない出来だった。

2020-07-23 18:30:55: > Get this to the top comment please!
2020-07-23 19:38:23: > Dude its a Demo of course the graphics wont be insane right off the bat. Its still like 5 months away from launch
2020-07-23 17:09:01: Like only for STALKER 2
2020-07-23 17:09:45: so, so, so bad.
2020-07-23 17:10:43: > Opinions
2020-07-23 17:23:29: > How so
2020-07-23 17:10:38: Ps5 God of war Spiderman horizon.... Xbox fps FPS FPS FPS....
2020-07-23 17:12:38: > Spiderman 6 hour dlc. God of war when? Horizon when?
2020-07-23 17:11:12: 12 tflops to play tetris, world's most powerful console!!!
2020-07-23 17:13:41: > 
2020-07-23 17:21:13: > Well duh
2020-07-23 17:23:00: > But... bugsnax?
2020-07-23 17:29:58: > LMFAO
2020-07-23 17:39:38: > @Luis Miranda bugsnax, Horizon, Spider Man Miles Morales... teraflopou, mas tem gente que vive num mundo de pirulito verde
2020-07-23 18:21:19: > @Luis Miranda XBOX showed similar games in the pre-show. They have to cater to different demographics.
2020-07-23 18:21:34: > At least they didnt show minecraft lmao
2020-07-23 18:25:19: > @I'll Be Honest Next presentation.
2020-07-23 18:31:44: > At least it will be at 120hz (hopefully)
2020-07-23 20:23:55: > An hour long video, and trolls focus on couple of minutes of tetris. Not even surprised.
2020-07-23 22:19:52: > Okamakiri Didn't you guys do the same to Bugsnax and Volcano High?
2020-07-24 01:30:49: > @Okamakiri I don't think their trolls. Just people who dislike it.
2020-07-24 17:06:30: > EXCLUSIVE
2020-07-24 19:12:29: > @I'll Be Honest haven't shown Minecraft maybe their biggest mistake !
2020-07-24 23:00:53: > but can it do Tetris @ 120 fps though!?
2020-07-25 07:56:44: > Nice cherry picking
2020-07-23 17:11:15: I was really hoping for rust
2020-07-23 17:12:48: Hands down. I love Halo and i will play this one. They made it look like back in the old days from Halo 1-3, but the weapon sounds are still kinda stupid in my opinion, not like they would be really powerful. And the new engine.. i dont know.. I do not warm up with this comic-style graphics so far.. Atriox looks like mush to me. I expected more from this new engine than that.
2020-07-24 03:18:57: > Are you implying its cel shaded? Some of ya'll must just be jaded from all the grey/brown color palletes in most shooters.
2020-07-23 17:12:55: I don't get the dislikes, most of the games look awesome and the reveal at the end was amazing.
2020-07-23 17:15:10: > Awesome on Xbox One
2020-07-23 17:15:22: > Are you serious dude ?
2020-07-23 17:16:02: > Have you seen the ps5 one?..........
2020-07-23 17:17:55: > Reign Wolf They barely showed gameplay after saying they would (Excluding Halo)
2020-07-23 17:39:03: > JimmyWasHere they said they would show infinite gameplay that was it.
2020-07-23 17:14:07: Fantastic showing.
2020-07-23 17:15:37: Absolutely clueless you people are
2020-07-23 17:16:28: another xbox event, another dissapointment.
2020-07-23 19:05:02: > Another kid that doesnt know how to spell
2020-07-23 19:28:45: > Out of curiosity. What would you have liked to see?? They showed almost every exclusive in there 19 year line up.
2020-07-23 21:42:35: > Johnathan Lee Hodges actual gameplay of more than halo infinite, all we got was cinematics and strong wahmen trailers for everything.
2020-07-23 21:59:52: > @Wayne welcome to 2015. It's been mostly that way since. Halo already took 25% of the Xbox event
2020-07-23 22:00:26: > @Wayne I'm assuming you mean women? Don't be sexist man
2020-07-24 02:42:23: > @Wayne About half the games had gameplay. Look again
2020-08-02 09:08:02: > Then Cry.
2020-07-23 17:16:41: Great show some very interesting games coming all on gamepass as well!
2020-07-23 17:16:44: "12 t-flops"
2020-07-23 17:17:08: After this Ive decided to buy the PS5 after buying both the 360 and the One
2020-07-23 17:21:12: > Lel
2020-07-23 17:21:52: > I think I'm gonna do the same ive tried to support them for so long but nothing today screamed wow i need this to me.
2020-07-23 17:33:10: > Same
2020-07-23 17:49:15: > Nobody in this thread has ever owned an Xbox
2020-07-23 17:52:26: > Same
2020-07-23 18:00:55: > Yep, Im with you on that one
2020-07-23 18:02:07: > RK same dude
2020-07-23 18:05:29: > Honestly same. I bought the Xbox one because I loved the 360 and wanted to support Xbox, but now Im starting to realize that Microsoft really just doesnt care about making their consoles good since they really dont have to
2020-07-23 18:30:19: > your dad um yes most ppl here did lol, then y u thinking theyre commenting
2020-07-23 18:45:58: > Fr I thought halo would convince me but idk as of right now it doesnt look good to me Ill probably go with the ps5
2020-07-23 18:55:03: > Gang Gang the graphics and gameplay looked like its from 2 generations ago, i thought it would excite me but theres nothing really making me want to buy it
2020-07-24 00:48:46: > @RK how?
2020-07-23 17:17:46: ㅋㅋㅋ 아오 기대한 내가 잘못이다
2020-07-23 17:33:32: > U are in the wrong one mate
2020-07-23 17:42:13: > Kane Mason right 
2020-07-23 17:19:47: I feel like this event helped Xbox clutch up in the Gulag now they just gotta get back in the game
2020-07-23 17:19:58: Ps5 win
2020-07-23 17:20:26: Im excited for state of decay 3.
2020-07-23 18:43:49: > Same even tho i still have to play the 2nd game and haven't finished the first game yet 
2020-07-23 18:58:43: > @Deathstranger bruh get on it then, i enjoyed the 2nd with 3 friends but i never played the 1st one so idk about that one
2020-07-23 19:04:24: > We have the same logo just im blue
2020-07-23 23:20:55: > You and me both, dude! That's my most anticipated game on the Series X.
2020-07-24 02:19:23: > Hopefully they actually have full on multiplayer. Not that super limited nonsense like in 2. Its really holding them back.
2020-07-24 11:28:53: > I too excited
2020-07-24 11:29:05: > Yeah I hope its the real graphics for xsx
2020-07-24 12:30:14: > I'm hoping the animations are polished this time. I didn't like how they held certain guns incorrectly.
2020-07-24 18:21:03: > Yes really excited. I really wanted to see different weather so im happy about that. Hopefully more clothing options and more vehicles etc.
2020-07-23 17:20:28: Y'all ready for some C G I
2020-07-23 17:20:42: 500 dislikes are the fortnite normies who kept saying RIP xbox and fortnite has better graphics

2020-07-23 17:23:35: This looks so much better than the stream, but the idiots wont even see how good it looks because...well... their idiots.
2020-07-23 17:23:49: Halo, Avowed, and Crossfire X have he interested. Only thing I liked from the PS5 event was Spider-Man
2020-07-23 17:26:43: > Same... except I would add Fable, State of Decay 3 and The Medium on the xbox side and Horizon Forbidden West and Ratchet and Clank on PS5
2020-07-23 17:24:47: Halo looks amazing
2020-07-23 17:24:52: Anyone else get Avatar vibes from the rare game
2020-07-23 17:25:05: Sorted out the lag now
2020-07-23 17:25:06: Xbox Series X i Love You
2020-07-23 17:27:39: > Oh Xbox loves you too because they know they're about to get another 500 dollars from you plus subscription fees and deliver mediocrity at best.
2020-07-23 17:25:10: 40:07 - STALKER 2
2020-07-23 17:35:11: > Thanks man, this game will save xbox
2020-07-23 17:49:13: > Literal goosebumps
2020-07-23 17:56:20: > Also on PS5.
2020-07-23 17:58:02: > kraenk12 pretty sure it said console launch exclusive
2020-07-23 19:03:44: > @kraenk12 52:43 You Lying... It doesnt even say it's gonna be on PC.   But I wouldnt doubt it's gonna be timed for PC though.
2020-07-23 19:23:32: > THANK YOU, funny when there's New Metro or especially New STALKER, everything else becomes stale.
2020-07-23 19:24:31: > @kraenk12 also on pc
2020-07-23 19:43:37: > @kraenk12 nop, only xbox and pc
2020-07-23 20:16:50: > Surprised more people aren't talking about that one
2020-07-23 23:09:38: > @Josh Cook Stalker started on PC, ofc it will be on PC. lol
2020-07-24 00:02:17: > Was starting to think I was the only one, the eejit millennials commenting all wetting their panties over some weirdo Japanese pish ignoring some of the real gold.
2020-07-24 04:07:25: > The only good game on here
2020-07-24 11:41:06: > @Josh Cook it  says windows pc right at the end of the trailer.
2020-07-24 18:09:28: > HYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYPE
2020-07-23 17:25:43: Ain't the grappling hook from doom but since im an og halo fan im good with it but they better not mess up halo it's been great all 5 of them 6 until i play this one
2020-07-23 17:32:03: > It makes me think of the grappling hook from Bulletstorm as well
2020-07-23 17:35:41: > I thought of titanfall 2
2020-07-23 17:26:23: That was lame
2020-07-23 17:27:01: I think this was amazing. Halo open world , yes plz! Stalker , fck yes! Fable , omg yes! And that other rpg from obsidian look very promising aswell ! From all the game streams we got these months i liked this the most so far :))
2020-07-23 17:27:12: Ponies are showing their dysfunction  great show Xbox!!
2020-07-23 17:27:33: Meh. I give it a 7.4 in terms of presentation
2020-07-23 17:27:36: the gunk
2020-07-23 17:27:36: 49:16 They sold me lol
2020-07-23 17:27:53: Putting it up on big screen right now 
2020-07-23 17:29:23: Im so hyped they just need to tell the price so that I can pre order it already
2020-07-23 17:29:38: XBOX NOT GAMEPLAY SHOWCASE
2020-07-23 17:29:46: Obsidian said we do fallout the best now we will do elder scrolls the best!
2020-07-23 17:30:36: Buying all those studio to make casual game.
2020-07-23 17:59:51: > "casual game"   Cringe.
2020-07-23 18:04:38: > @Moh Yes, game for you and 10 year old. If I wanted to play those game, I'll whip out my Switch or Steam has tons.
2020-07-23 21:30:57: > Man this comment was cringe
2020-07-24 05:38:55: > @Kerninja the Frog Frog gotta be mad, stay salty my friend.
2020-07-23 17:30:41: I loved your show! Thank you very much! Definitely gonna buy the new XBOX, great games ahead!
2020-07-23 17:31:45: Blew the ps5 event, that one was filled with bugsnax and goodbye volcano high, this one had THE games
2020-07-23 17:32:23: Look at that 4K 60FPS video!
2020-07-23 17:32:45: 8 in coolness 5 in gameplay
2020-07-23 17:32:53: Wow even the higher res vod doesnt help Halo Infinite looking like an early 360 game. How disappointing.
2020-07-23 17:33:15: That looks much better than the actual live stream!!
2020-07-23 17:33:50: Disappointed.
2020-07-23 17:34:06: Well sh*t, massive forza fan but that trailer was dead, ps5 winning on games i think.
2020-07-23 17:34:25: Outstanding. Like 7 or 8 games here Im eager for. And Halo gameplay was insane.
2020-07-23 18:34:19: > Insane? What was so insane on this? Same as the previous one
2020-07-23 17:34:30: FABLE!!!!!
2020-07-23 17:51:14: > YEEEESSSS
2020-07-23 18:10:21: > AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
2020-07-24 17:07:29: > Chicken Chaser returns
2020-07-23 17:34:32: Still nothing like the graphics level and attention to detail like the last of us part 2, not surprised tbh
2020-07-23 17:48:11: > yo they are games, how bad do people what to "immerse" and escape reality ?? lmao IT'S A GAME
2020-07-23 18:03:50: > ginger thats not my point lmao
2020-07-23 17:34:36: Loved the showcase! Keep up the great work
2020-07-23 17:37:48: > Really?  What did you like?  Im struggling for anything positive.
2020-07-23 17:55:38: > Justin Jones In terms of games Im actually excited for I would say Halo, Fable, The Medium, Avowed, Hellblade 2, State of Decay 3, warhammer 40,000 Darktide, Everwild, and while the the other games may not have really interested me, I understand that they probably did look good to someone else. They Showed us 22 games, thats pretty impressive, and Yes I do wish we would have gotten more gameplay, but the trailers were still good and Im sure well get more gameplay as it gets closer to the release date.
2020-07-23 18:11:44: > Just my 2 cents...
2020-07-23 19:08:06: > I thought it was great
2020-08-19 01:35:15: > I thought it was great
2020-07-23 17:35:32: Idk about you guys but halo seems more interesting when its not just the chief, like in halo 4,3, and the beginning of halo 2 that was epic
2020-07-23 17:35:40: #PCmasterrace
2020-07-23 17:40:20: > Good for you bud
2020-07-23 18:20:55: > Why are you even here?
2020-07-23 17:36:10: Tbh Ps5 showcase reveal was better..
2020-07-23 18:02:32: > I'm still struggling to see what's so bad about this showcase. Can someone please explain? I mean look at Forza, it looks so good
2020-07-23 20:02:15: > @Prism Games Lots of people loved it. Don't mind others. Nothing can please everyone.
2020-07-23 17:36:35: Those new Destiny 2 subclases look wonderful
2020-07-23 17:36:45: Halo looked so good! Cant wait to play it on Xbox series x.
2020-07-23 17:36:47: How did you guys not mention Flight Simulator??
2020-07-23 17:46:03: > Aj Bronas they brought the BIG ones
2020-07-23 17:47:26: > GomaPlayzYT if that was the case they would also have show Minecraft RTX
2020-07-23 17:50:27: > @GomaPlayzYT yeah like tetris
2020-07-23 18:30:39: > Probably getting delayed
2020-07-23 18:33:07: > Wouldnt suprise me if theyd cancel it
2020-07-23 19:36:25: > who plays flight simulator on console.
2020-07-23 19:56:38: > Because it on ps
2020-07-23 17:38:17: I need to change my boxers
2020-07-23 17:38:25: Xbox: has disappointing show  Gamers waiting to play Demon Souls, Spider-Man, Horizon zero dawn 2: thats rough buddy
2020-07-23 17:45:53: > Hold this L
2020-07-23 17:38:29: Getting westworld intro vibes here
2020-07-23 17:38:51: Halo infinite looks cartoony
2020-07-23 18:05:40: > I thought it was low poly !
2020-07-23 18:09:40: > They forgot to turn on RayTrace.
2020-07-23 18:35:33: > Halo has always looked cartoony. Or at least since 3.
2020-07-23 18:42:27: > It kinda looks like halo wars 2
2020-07-23 18:44:56: > It's never enough for y'all lmao
2020-07-23 18:46:59: > Its still on demo so it can be improvements
2020-07-23 19:06:29: > Diego Candelaria 5:10 the background looks like fcking Minecraft 
2020-07-23 19:33:08: > better than what halo 5 looked like
2020-07-23 23:25:19: > And dissapointing
2020-07-23 23:41:08: > People wanted the "old" art style and now that they got it they complain.
2020-07-24 02:06:37: > Why because its colorful? Looks like Halo has always looked.
2020-07-24 20:00:13: > Ill pass on halo fortfinite
2020-07-24 20:01:17: > @docc19 thats kinda the issue.
2020-07-24 23:03:52: > didint look that impressive to be honest. lighting was so bland.
2020-07-25 05:18:11: > Halo looks worse than the original Crysis. Epic fail
2020-07-23 17:39:03: So based on what I have seen so far my list goes as follows...  1. HELLBLADE 2. Halo 3. CrossfireX 4. State Of Decay 3
2020-07-23 17:55:08: > you forgot microsoft flight simulator
2020-08-02 09:02:33: > STALKER 2
2020-07-23 17:39:19: Boring card graphics games practically all pc games in short will not be worth the console
2020-07-23 17:39:33: With just announcing Halo Infinite and State of Decay 3 Im sold. Watch the haters ignore this video being 4k footage.
2020-07-23 17:40:10: I finished D2 long ago.  Where was the next generation gameplay and the mic drop moments.  Xbox needs to get with the times!
2020-07-23 18:59:25: > IKR! I now just remembered that I YouTuber who mentioned about the mic drop moments smh
2020-07-23 17:40:20: Wow everything in halo looks like it was made from plastic 
2020-07-23 17:43:03: > Wow Im a total dumbass that only cares about graphic.
2020-07-23 17:44:38: > @Lord Faggatron will graphics are very important

2020-07-23 17:50:50: > @Lord Faggatron Graphic Matter when you're the most Powerful console.
2020-07-23 17:51:20: > I know graphics arent everything. But it doesnt look as good as I expected considering how long we have had to wait. And the gameplay doesnt do anything new really
2020-07-23 18:02:25: > KZ#001 Yes but you guys are also forgetting its not finished.
2020-07-23 18:47:25: > That grappling hook was pretty hype though
2020-07-23 17:40:32: Excellent can't wait to buy the x series console. :)
2020-07-23 17:40:41: Everwild seemed interesting i hope the graphics and animations are the same of gameplay, i mean it's not impossible.
2020-07-23 17:40:46: Game over Xbox. I cant believe I gave them another chance and wasted one hour of my life. Ffs easy PS5 win.
2020-07-23 17:46:04: > Ps5 did the same thing
2020-07-23 17:47:48: > Its a console my dude calm your titties
2020-07-23 17:51:56: > t h a n k s . Im calm. I just dislike the way they overhyped everyone again and delivered nothing. I wanted gameplay not movies.
2020-07-23 18:45:12: > @Lionheart5  lol and what did ps5 reveal ? Some Spider-Man dlc , the next horizon game , and some indies .
2020-07-24 03:25:23: > @Lionheart5 And you got gameplay for like half the games they showed. Just because it wasnt in the same way they presented the Halo gameplay doesn't mean those reveals didn't show gameplay.
2020-07-23 17:41:18: Ohh... Elden Ring.
2020-07-23 17:41:33: the games look so crisp and perfect , I cant wait !
2020-07-23 17:49:33: > Wait...which video did you watch?
2020-07-23 17:51:30: > @Emmanuel Mbala they do look good
2020-07-23 17:51:51: > Emmanuel Mbala bro they look amazing?? Youre joking right??
2020-07-23 18:06:44: > @kinggj tg Really? Like, really though? Halo Infinite literally had pop in. Rocks to limit line of sight everywhere. It was mediocre at best. Best looking game by far was Everwild. Everything else was just meh (aside from the trailers which were well put together).
2020-07-24 03:00:39: > @Emmanuel Mbala Everwild won't actually look like that though. None of it was gameplay.
2020-07-23 17:42:00: 6:27 miren todos quien llegó
2020-07-23 17:42:46: Halo looks good they just need to tweak the graphics and abilities. It'll be better at release.
2020-07-23 17:43:41: Pc gamers be looking at this and are like oh only 60FPS
2020-07-23 17:43:49: Xbox 360 graphics
2020-07-23 17:45:08: 20 mins in 3 games all amazing... Xbox series X, Take my money.
2020-07-23 17:45:32: > ?
2020-07-23 17:58:46: > R.i.p Xbox
2020-07-23 17:46:03: I just don't understand why tetris was one of the games you needed to show us
2020-07-23 17:49:51: > Variety, theres your answer sweet and simple
2020-07-23 17:54:45: > Halo didn't look much better tbh.
2020-07-23 17:55:13: > Uhm, PS5 showed some random games too. Its variety. Smh.
2020-07-23 20:20:00: > @Paul Ramos like?
2020-07-24 02:25:20: > @IceStorm Bugsnax...who actually wanted that?
2020-07-24 15:02:11: > @docc19 but it was new, the Xbox show should've been 35-40 min
2020-07-23 17:46:11: "Nowadays, [youngsters] don't know who [Master Chief John-117] was [M]aybe they know [] he disappeared or something nobody in this country [] didn't know who [Chief] was." May this change.
2020-07-23 17:47:26: I'm looking forward to more tone-deaf virtue signalling from Microsoft in 2021.
2020-07-23 17:58:32: > Im not sure you know what those words mean
2020-07-23 18:10:51: > @your dad I mean hes kinda right. I didn't watch the full thing so I didn't see any virtue signalling in this specific video.
2020-07-23 17:47:44: Halo Infinite look´s great and can play in my xbox one, Dec 2021 gonna get XSX

2020-07-23 17:52:39: Whos excited for tetris?  medium looked really interesting!!
2020-07-23 17:52:50: Liked that reveal. Halo Infinite looks amazing and as an avid Destiny 2 fan, I'm really looking forward to Beyond Light. Love that encase and shatter ability! Dear Santa, can I have an Xbox Series X, Halo Infinite and Destiny 2 Beyond Light. I promise I'll be good - well mostly.
2020-07-23 17:53:16: #TeamPlaystation
2020-07-23 18:57:07: > ok
2020-07-23 17:53:22: ️️
2020-07-23 17:53:22: Ive always been on Xboxs side with all of this and waited for this event to see what console Ill be going to but it looks like Ps5 got this one...
2020-07-23 17:56:39: > Im getting both. They both had pretty good game conferences.
2020-07-23 18:00:20: > Xbox all the way man
2020-07-23 18:43:08: > Xbox literally shows better games lol
2020-07-23 18:52:58: > @EldyPlaysGames suuuure lol
2020-07-23 19:08:44: > EldyPlaysGames 
2020-07-23 19:16:05: > EldyPlaysGames ok bud
2020-07-23 19:19:37: > @Kennesaw's Best Yep
2020-07-23 19:22:46: > EldyPlaysGames it just wasnt for me tbh
2020-07-23 19:25:42: > @Omar Corona Good games aren't for you, I guess.
2020-07-23 19:33:31: > EldyPlaysGames how old are you
2020-07-23 19:56:39: > Idk man the ps5 game reveal was pretty meh as well
2020-07-23 20:18:40: > @General Grant better that this one at least
2020-07-23 20:24:24: > Global Occult Coalition Some of the games on the ps5 livestream were better in my opinion like Spider-Man, ghostwire, horizon and hitman 3. They even looked better even though the Xbox has more power
2020-07-23 20:25:29: > EldyPlaysGames only good game that really got my interest was Forza gz thats about it
2020-07-23 20:58:25: > Omar Corona and they didnt even bother showing gameplay
2020-07-24 00:43:13: > Kennesaw's Best you right bout that, Ima give it another chance before I make my actual decision
2020-07-23 17:54:18: Deeply mediocre. We thought they have learned their lesson...apparently not. Spencer also continued to call timed exclusives exclusives, as usual.
2020-07-23 18:07:54: > Yep. I'm going to ps5 this year.
2020-07-23 18:22:57: > There gonna release more gameplay footage later
2020-07-23 17:54:22: After watching this, I'm buying the PS5 for sure. I'm a long time Xbox fan but not anymore. I had low expectations for this event but MS still managed to disappoint me.
2020-07-23 17:54:23: Thats it? Wack.
2020-07-23 17:55:21: 57:27 fortnite omfg
2020-07-23 17:55:48: Good show but not better than PlayStation's imo
2020-07-23 17:57:46: I hope Halo was shown on an easy mode.
2020-07-23 18:13:56: > It was on game jerno mode
2020-07-23 18:38:28: > How do ou believe that.. this there showcase they need to show the full power of the console not the easy mode
2020-07-24 02:38:22: > @ريان الشهري Easy mode != have anything to do with power.
2020-07-24 03:09:24: > @Kenji Fox Microsoft didn't say anything about your so called "easy mode" don't give excuses please I don't want to get hyped for nothing
2020-07-25 17:57:57: > It was on Normal mode. You could see the icon for Normal difficulty in the map when the player pulled it up.
2020-07-23 17:58:16: Not impressed at all
2020-07-23 17:58:59: Better luck next time Xbox.
2020-07-23 18:00:09: 1.2k ps fangirls already disliked?? Nice!! 
2020-07-23 18:00:18: I am officially hollowed now
2020-07-23 18:01:10: OMG Xbox completely destroyed the PS5 today.. holy sh!t
2020-07-23 18:02:05: They don't do marketing with their games, they do games with their marketing
2020-07-23 18:02:13: Bon... Fable et c'est tout.
2020-07-23 18:02:51: Microsoft Need to change their name to Wokerosoft

2020-07-23 18:04:22: When they still have those elevator loading screens 
2020-07-23 18:36:02: > What you mean?
2020-07-23 18:50:04: > @Alice In HELL at 6:58 tou can see the distant objects loading while going up the elevator.
2020-07-23 19:41:07: > @Sushrut Ahire ooooh like the textures that are rendering?
2020-07-23 19:41:46: > cos its not ps5 baby.

2020-07-24 00:55:23: > And with PS3 graphics
2020-07-24 09:00:49: > Microsoft Cyn build better games than god of war but don't expect it on game pass
2020-07-24 11:03:44: > Its in beta chill out
2020-07-23 18:05:11: we have enough car games to last us to the next decade

2020-07-23 18:06:10: this runs like 45fps with 60 from time to time
2020-07-23 22:30:38: > I suppose it's a minor step up from the usual 20-30 on the xbox one.
2020-07-23 18:06:21: Ps5 : gta 5 2  XSX: destiny 2 2

2020-07-23 18:58:45: > Did you mean GTA 5 3?
2020-07-23 19:14:00: > Not liking the sound of 'Bungie are also releasing..." At least GTA V will be free if you already own it on PS. This sounds like you have to buy Destiny again, but could be wrong.
2020-07-23 19:20:15: > switch: zelda BOTW 2

2020-07-23 21:57:10: > Steven McGovern Luke Smith already said Destiny has smart delivery
2020-07-23 22:18:18: > @Steven McGovern It's the opposite.  It sounds like Destiny 2, all previous DLC, and the new DLC will be free with Gamepass and optimized for Series X.
2020-07-23 22:24:00: > XSX : tetris
2020-07-23 22:53:05: > Looking forward to playing GTA 5 in 8 years at 4K 120 Hz on the Xbox Series X 2

2020-07-26 04:21:09: > Steven McGovern you dont have to buy destiny 2 again, they confirmed this. Its smart delivery
2020-07-29 07:39:39: > Oooh its DLC? I was soooo confused. I was like Destiny 2 2? The fuh.

2020-09-16 17:38:28: > What are you talkin about Destiny will be nothing compared to Halo
2020-09-26 10:59:22: > @Steven McGovern all your current destiny dlc will upgrade to new console
2020-07-23 18:07:18: Thank for wasting one hour of my life
2020-07-23 18:14:56: > Mohammed Sadeq Why?
2020-07-24 03:23:46: > Technically it was 57 mins. Just proves you didn't actually watch it or you'd know how long it actually was.
2020-07-24 08:01:57: > docc19 really thats your way of argument   I spent 3 more mins shocked at the screen as they said thank you for watching
2020-07-23 18:08:15: Boring!
2020-07-23 18:08:18: I feel Xbox love!
2020-07-23 18:08:34: Ps5 for me this year. Nothing here really interested me. :(
2020-07-23 18:13:43: > You'll rather have Bugsnax and 30fps games on Ps5?
2020-07-23 18:08:36: They said they gonna show they changed. Night of mic drop and gameplay. TLOU2 & Ghost of tsusima looked way better than anything they showed.. uncharted 4 and gow, HZD and spiderman looked betrer #mic drop
2020-07-23 18:08:51: Everwild looks amazing. Good job RARE.
2020-07-23 18:09:44: State of decay 3, Darktide, stalker 2, Fable, Halo pretty hyped
2020-07-23 18:14:35: > do not forget microsoft flight simulator
2020-07-23 18:20:54: > Not to mention all on game pass not gonna pay that full price tag of $70
2020-07-23 18:29:15: > @I'll Be Honest Too bad you'll never truly own the games lol.
2020-07-23 19:44:08: > @I'll Be Honest but they cost $100 by the time you end your sub
2020-07-24 02:30:18: > @ash fair The first party games never leave the service so if you're getting your money's worth why would you ever drop the sub?
2020-08-02 08:58:41: > Hellblade 2, avowed and the medium.
2020-07-23 18:10:17: Entäuscht.
2020-07-23 18:10:42: R.I.P PS5
2020-07-23 18:12:25: > How cuz there showcase pulled 25 mill views when Xbox only has 46k so tell me how ? 
2020-07-23 18:11:10: So nowadays it's all about 60 fps and 4k? That doesn't make mediocre games good.
2020-07-23 18:15:40: > besides halo, there was nothing exciting. period.
2020-07-23 18:46:27: > Better games than the ps5. You're blind and biased if you cant see that 
2020-07-23 20:27:12: > @Bella Boucher sure...
2020-07-23 18:11:28: Why so much dislikes?? I dont get it.. Anyone can explain?       Really tho, I dont get it, explain pls 
2020-07-23 18:13:49: > PS5 noobs dislike the video. Even though most of there games are just as bad.
2020-07-23 18:14:33: > Trolls and unrealistic expectations
2020-07-23 18:16:00: > Not meeting their expectations. (I.E. being the most powerful console and showing 120 for a 4 year old platformer.)
2020-07-23 18:17:33: > SPINZBY DAGAMER ghost of Tsushima last of us 2 spider man god of war days gone until dawn horizon zero dawn Detroit become human and infamous these games are also one of the biggest games ever sold so you wanna lie some more ?
2020-07-23 18:21:13: > I disliked this because Microsoft gave us ENORMOUS expectations, i mean ENORMOUS, and we only got 8 minutes of gameplay, I mean, we are 5 months until they release the console and we didnt saw what we are going to play.
2020-07-23 18:23:54: > Ps5 fan boys are upset
2020-07-23 18:29:07: > Jack Figary cuz we dont have Tetris halo and fable .........ok 
2020-07-26 18:19:17: > Xbox fanboys only say were salty and upset yet their event flopped just as always. And they say its the most powerfull console, yet they proceed to show halo infinite, which has xbox 360 graphics.
2020-07-23 18:12:07: Always hyped to see new Psychonauts stuff!

2020-07-23 18:55:25: > Yeah only little kids have console wars.
2020-07-23 19:06:49: > @Ashley Garcia Only little kids should fight about which business brand or sports team or phone operating system.
2020-07-23 19:16:01: > What does the year has to do with this?
2020-07-23 19:57:36: > Still? its escalating even more
2020-07-23 21:45:09: > Right? Its nerf or nuthin
2020-07-23 21:51:37: > Both consoles probably have the same processing power and capabilities and have good games it's just at this point people argue if they like green case or blue case
2020-07-23 22:18:59: > Well I'm not buying both
2020-07-23 22:48:02: > @vruv vv Processing power has never been "the same" or anything close to it, but usually it's just people fighting over exclusives which are bad for competition anyways, let anyone play whatever games the want on whatever platform they want, hardware permitting
2020-07-24 00:28:26: > Doubt it will stop
2020-07-24 00:31:48: > @Arcadian oh yeah? Do you game on the razer toaster?
2020-07-24 01:53:41: > and your name suggest you dont??

2020-07-24 03:39:27: > It's called competition DS. Pretty much the driver of innovation!
2020-07-24 05:31:14: > Real men play on PC...      ......and buy all the consoles anyway.
2020-07-24 05:40:24: > console wars will exist man, its normal...
2020-07-24 18:19:25: > @Shayhan um point
2020-07-24 19:48:58: > It's sad right. I see so many people complaining about every little thing.
2020-07-24 21:48:49: > in 2020 people war about everything.
2020-07-25 01:54:46: > Yes because I mean Xbox games you can play on pc. Not impressive.
2020-07-23 18:23:48: They showed...    NOTHING
2020-07-23 18:23:49: Very dissapointed with halo but the other games looks great

2020-07-24 18:35:49: > When you can actually see the blocks move down smoothly... such bliss.
2020-07-24 21:50:50: > In their defense it was the only indie game we saw
2020-07-25 01:55:33: > I was actually hoping for pong. Bring it back with those Halo graphics.
2020-07-25 03:56:11: > M$FT Pinball @ 8K 60fps

2020-08-03 06:30:56: > Been waiting years for this !
2020-07-23 18:24:54: Bloody hell, that was lame...
2020-07-23 18:26:56: > How?
2020-07-23 18:24:54: 1st time in 18 years......  Not bothering, bye felicia.
2020-07-23 18:25:22: Most of these games look like they could run on the Xbox 360..... also whats up with all the baby games?
2020-07-23 19:21:00: > You obviously don't know how game development and Processing power works.
2020-07-23 18:26:37: Amazing show!
2020-07-23 18:27:06: This like movie
2020-07-23 18:27:07: These reveals were so underwhelming, the trailers were so boring, and halo infinite looks just... eh.
2020-07-23 18:27:29: It was decent
2020-07-23 18:28:39: This presentation sucked because I can literally play all of these games on the og Xbox one. Im 100% getting the ps5.
2020-07-23 18:31:53: > You can't. Not all the games are playable on the one
2020-07-23 18:32:27: > Good for you. Im getting both.
2020-07-23 18:41:29: > That's just not true, look at the trailers again and see where they state the platforms. If you are to stupid to understand then maybe it's better to stay elsewhere indeed.
2020-07-23 18:29:31: Those AI in halo are pretty bad, just stand there and get shot
2020-07-23 18:37:27: > He was probably playing on easy mode just for the showcase
2020-07-23 20:43:33: > @Florida Flexn probably, still have alot of time before release just hope it's not mindless killing easy enemies on what seems to be destiny patrols
2020-07-23 18:29:43: I think I quit video games
2020-07-23 18:30:13: Una completa mierda está conferencia ni un solo juego me interesó creo que mejor iré por un ps5  horribles todos los juegos
2020-07-23 18:31:03: Fable shhahahahahshehejehebebbehejeieissiiasisishshshsbebshshhsshahahahshwhshshshhs
2020-07-23 18:32:10: What's the music in the background for Hellblade 2 at 32:40 ?
2020-07-23 18:45:10: > Its part of the first game's Soundtrack
2020-07-23 19:12:51: > It's called 'Hela' from the official soundtrack
2020-07-24 09:21:32: > Thanks guys!
2020-07-23 18:32:13: Mehhh boring
2020-07-23 18:32:15: The most exciting part was the Cyberpunk teaser in that one Honey I Shrunk the Kids trailer.
2020-07-23 18:35:47: > And I think that was in the pre show. Yikes.
2020-07-23 18:40:32: > Nahh
2020-07-23 19:28:21: > I hope they also make the sequel game, Honey I blew Up The Kid
2020-07-23 20:11:11: > This comment reeks of insecurity and ignorance.
2020-07-23 20:22:48: > @theAMOG Insecurity and ignorance? Stop.
2020-07-23 20:31:26: > @AllPro777 Leave them alone. I am insecure about my...video games. 
2020-07-23 23:40:15: > @philthestampede That's sad.
2020-07-24 09:57:33: > AllPro777 its sarcasm
2020-07-24 12:50:12: > @Osvaldas Paslauskas I'd keep working on that.
2020-07-25 01:11:58: > @theAMOG this reeks of denial.
2020-07-25 02:22:40: > @AllPro777 As you should keep working on being capable of telling the difference...
2020-07-23 18:32:26: Chief who?
2020-07-23 18:32:32: What do you guys think of the new Halo? Its kinda meh... to me. I mean compared to Doom Eternal.
2020-07-23 18:34:29: > it looks pretty much the same
2020-07-24 02:58:01: > @Mythos De Muerta That's what most fans wanted. They wanted something like the original 3 Halo games, the one's that Bungie made.
2020-07-23 18:33:08: Ok but can I play halo infinite on my current Xbox one?
2020-07-23 18:36:13: > Yes it said that at the end of the demo for Halo.
2020-07-23 18:36:27: > yea u can at the end of the gameplay it says XBSX l XB1 l PC
2020-07-23 18:55:18: > Should be able to run the original Xbox by the looks of it.
2020-07-23 18:33:24: What about the new Kinect?? 
2020-07-23 18:37:44: > Haha ya wtf. Where's the bundle
2020-07-23 19:23:44: > Discontinued
2020-07-23 18:34:20: Wow the grapple hook in halo looked so weird and out of place, the guns looks off too.
2020-07-23 18:34:59: Winows PC + PS5 Sorted
2020-07-23 18:35:43: Can Halo Infinite run on an Xbox 360 ? I bet it can.
2020-07-23 18:58:54: > It sure looks like it.
2020-07-23 18:35:57: Americans : exist  Covid: I am going to end this American whole carrer
2020-07-23 18:38:56: > Stop liking you're own comment
2020-07-23 18:37:58: mehhhhhh
2020-07-23 18:38:01: Great looking line up, some good variety and art styles in that showcase. oh don't scroll down people the salty fanboys are already out in force.
2020-07-23 18:40:25: Straight fire
2020-07-23 18:40:45: :(
2020-07-23 18:42:15: Thank you, Phil. From now I'm gonna buy Xbox Series X
2020-07-23 18:42:31: Halo infinite beter be good, because 343 has been killing this legendary series. Man I really want bungie back right now.
2020-07-23 18:44:11: > Bungieliver?
2020-07-23 19:27:47: > Yes bungie did it well.
2020-07-23 21:30:07: > Nostalgia gives you rose tinted glasses. All the red flags just look like flags if you have them on
2020-07-24 02:45:09: > I mean once they fixed MCC that's been going pretty strong actually. People still play it frequently.
2020-07-23 18:43:27: So would you rather play Tetris....or Bugsnax...
2020-07-23 18:52:49: > curruption018 pick your poison
2020-07-23 19:19:36: > Bugsnax 100%
2020-07-23 19:22:29: > or both cos im crazy
2020-07-23 19:38:36: > I'd rather play bugsnax than another Halo game butchered by microsoft
2020-07-23 19:39:53: > Tetris or *furry dinosaur highschool drama*
2020-07-23 19:51:07: > erick matias yañez guzmán  To be fair its better then Sonys furry game
2020-07-23 18:43:39: Anyone else notice those textures loading in around 7:00 ?   Unrestricted development huh.... 
2020-07-23 18:45:34: > that's mesh LOD.
2020-07-23 18:48:59: > Yeah i was surprised by the distant fog in the environment that was just blinking into existence as he was going up the elevator
2020-07-23 18:56:59: > They still have some development time
2020-07-23 19:14:58: > @Badeend That's where that 40x SSD suppose to kick in.
2020-07-23 23:12:05: > Some where dissapearing and reappearing?
2020-07-23 23:56:55: > They didn't have enough framerate to power that elevator so It drew some from the environment.
2020-07-23 23:58:17: > Ikr, pretty pathetic. If you're going to make big claims, make sure to back them up big.
2020-07-24 16:34:45: > 7:06
2020-07-24 19:22:59: > @Johnny TimeStamp Lol you do live up to your name, sir
2020-07-23 18:43:50: Yup, it's almost confirmed that the consoles will be delayed lol
2020-07-23 18:44:41: wow xbox showing off that xbox 360 12 tf LOL xbox rip on this day
2020-07-23 18:45:50: Wow, i really enjoyed the showcase but after reading the comments i see that people nowadays are very hard to please x.x
2020-07-23 18:59:19: > Insecure people.
2020-07-23 18:59:55: > Most likely non Xbox fans thats all dont pay any attention, best presentation m$ has had in 7 years
2020-07-23 19:00:29: > Pretty sad, they are so spoiled
2020-07-23 19:04:15: > Jaecyn I agree this made my decision to buy the series x after I get the 5
2020-07-23 19:05:14: > Mostly ponies
2020-07-23 19:06:46: > It's human nature, some people will like it, others won't.
2020-07-23 19:47:30: > Compare to the ps5 showcase I'm sorry for you guys
2020-07-23 20:10:01: > @Noah Rod Must suck to be poor.
2020-07-23 20:21:46: > @theAMOG Don'r call us poor when your games look like they came out 5 years ago.
2020-07-23 20:55:39: > @Weebish ERROR plus half the games that were shown in the ps5 reveal are still coming to xbox
2020-07-23 21:17:58: > Loved it too! 
2020-07-23 21:36:34: > Global Occult Coalition ok?
2020-07-23 21:42:47: > @Jaecyn that's the problem, the content they showed should've been ready to play, 7+ yrs of nothing and they're still making ppl wait.
2020-07-23 22:55:06: > Yeap, I thought it was solid, these games still have months of polish to go, some people need years of polish
2020-07-24 00:01:50: > That's what happens when you say you got all this power and promise to deliver. I haven't seen anything yet to back up what they've been claiming. PS4's Horizon Zero Dawn looks way better than this Halo game. The new Ghost Of Tsushima looks better as well. So much for TFLOP superiority.
2020-07-24 01:50:18: > @BokaLoka320 Takes time to acquire studios and for them to start new projects and finish up their current projects.
2020-07-23 18:47:22: Sounds great
2020-07-23 18:47:59: S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 HOLY MOLY!!!
2020-07-23 19:46:56: > Really?
2020-07-23 22:02:03: > Was stalker 1 even on xbox?
2020-07-23 22:17:47: > *Cheeki Breeki Intensifies*
2020-07-24 01:25:53: > Man, Stalker was problably the most immersive game did i play. Yees!
2020-07-24 09:31:10: > Thank God its multiplatform. Cant wait to play it on my PS5 
2020-07-24 14:55:36: > @Giannis MP96 it's not coming to ps5 lmao
2020-07-24 19:02:38: > @Giannis MP96 uh oh
2020-08-19 01:20:25: > Giannis MP96 its a timed exclusive
2020-08-20 12:40:57: > @Giannis MP96 imagine going to the xbox release showcase to comment this, ya'll console fanboys really got nothing better to do
2020-07-23 18:48:45: Better than EAs conference lol
2020-07-23 20:24:29: > While I agree with you, let's be honest, that's a pretty low bar to set.
2020-07-23 20:39:41: > Kalak&Shinx The hell did EA even show off? I've completely forgotten.
2020-07-23 20:43:55: > @pennylessz Basically the only thing of real interest to most people was the reveal that they were developing Skate 4, but that's all they said, they had nothing to show. The rest was some stupid fortnite knock-off with ROCKET LAUNCHERS ONLY (lmao) and some stuff about Apex Legends and Star Wars.
2020-07-23 21:41:39: > @Kalak&Shinx They really don't bother to release new games before the new consoles out lmao
2020-07-24 07:11:30: > Kalak&Shinx Im pretty sure most people were mostly interested of squadrons.
2020-07-24 09:29:28: > I think the EA show and this show were close in quality.
2020-07-24 11:58:34: > EA conference announced just the crossplay in their games
2020-07-24 18:14:53: > @pennylessz I know right?
2020-07-24 19:22:11: > Better than Sonys too but not by much
2020-07-24 19:30:55: > @serialkiller77 not really 
2020-07-24 21:59:27: > Forgot Ubisoft?
2020-07-25 08:31:59: > @serialkiller77 
2020-08-07 11:13:48: > pennylessz apex legends so coming to switch
2020-07-23 18:49:32: Crossfire x not on PC?
2020-07-23 18:49:38: Bro Im so excited for Halo Infinite holy
2020-07-23 18:56:59: > Yeah bro same, it looks so good
2020-07-23 18:50:57: one word, cringe
2020-07-23 18:51:32: CONSOLE LAUNCH              EXCLUSIVE                *Xbox Series X | Windows PC*  ..huh..?
2020-07-23 18:51:59: Wow halo looks the same after all these years plz hold this L
2020-07-23 18:59:41: > Okay bro, make and develop your own ground breaking halo game that will please 100% of gamers, oh wait...
2020-07-24 03:11:19: > Yes and that's exactly what the true fans wanted. They strayed too far from what made Halo as beloved as it was with 4 & 5. Infinite should be its return to form for most fans.
2020-07-23 18:52:04: FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABLE!!!! HOLY F S. <3
2020-07-23 18:52:28: what about gta?
2020-07-23 20:30:22: > Pfff, 3 years more
2020-07-23 18:53:35: bravo
2020-07-23 18:54:51: The only thing going for that PS5 was Spider-Man  to be honest.
2020-07-23 18:55:57: That Halo demo..I mean the game looks good..but those graphics are supposed to be the ground breaking graphics on the Xbox series x?
2020-07-23 18:59:44: > Crazy seeing comments like this. I seriously thought it might have been just me while watching it.
2020-07-23 19:00:12: > Do you not understand its in beta or are you just one to judge to quickly
2020-07-23 19:01:15: > Jaime Villarreal in beta? Its released in 2 months, its barely going to be re built from the ground up you parcel
2020-07-23 19:04:26: > Gutted. Can't even say it's because it was overhyped; that genuinely looked bad, from the gameplay to the groundbreaking Roblox visuals.
2020-07-23 19:04:27: > It looked bad on the stream better at 4k but not as good as the E3 2018 showing
2020-07-23 19:05:55: > (even partially) OW, 4k 60FPS, that's why...
2020-07-23 19:06:43: > @Formula Apex please look at the video again and you'll see it in beta 
2020-07-23 19:08:37: > @Jaime Villarreal This man said its in beta.... Surely you jest?? lol
2020-07-23 19:12:00: > It releases for the old XboxOne as well. So it cant push the limits like we hoped for it to do. Sadly
2020-07-23 19:12:04: > Its still being polished I think
2020-07-23 19:12:12: > its the art style they have going for its this game! graphics are insane!
2020-07-23 19:14:11: > @Jaime Villarreal where did you find word "beta" I wanna see it
2020-07-23 19:15:45: > tbh I think we've hit peak graphics, I wouldn't expect to see many games in the future that look much better than the ones we have already
2020-07-23 19:18:14: > Maybe it will launch on xbox360
2020-07-23 19:23:37: > @Trace6x there are better looking games made last generation...
2020-07-23 19:25:09: > @Trace6x you must be trolling
2020-07-23 19:27:08: > That's what you get when you prioritize framerate over graphics. Wasn't that what people wanted anyways?
2020-07-23 19:29:06: > It had some frame dips as we'll...
2020-07-23 19:30:31: > newest doom looked much much better
2020-07-23 19:31:12: > Its not so much graphics its more effects like water air and the FPS
2020-07-23 19:33:15: > Demo demo spell it D E M O demo I wonder if its a demo DEMO
2020-07-23 19:40:50: > Still looks good
2020-07-23 19:44:43: > It looked plastic like, everything was too smooth and shiny.
2020-07-23 19:51:15: > I'm more concerned about the bland combat, when you compare it to Doom Eternal, it looks kinda embarrassing
2020-07-23 20:06:32: > looks like gamecube graphics lmfao
2020-07-23 20:10:22: > I don't think you understand that it's an open world game.
2020-07-23 20:10:44: > Trace6x they said that when the ps3 dropped
2020-07-23 20:15:48: > it's a YouTube video, obviously it won't look as good as the actual game
2020-07-23 20:20:03: > @Rafael Balsan There are games that released years ago that have trailers that look better than this.
2020-07-23 20:33:58: > I liked it, I'd rather have higher FPS, and the gameplay looked solid
2020-07-23 20:46:05: > That moment when the Halo 2 remake looks better than it.
2020-07-23 20:50:21: > you've probably seem so many FPSs by now that you just can't tell the changes, like for me Halo, Gears, Destiny etc, all have looked the same since the 360
2020-07-23 21:10:45: > @Btg_Drae ramember ghost of tsushima 2018? it looked even back then better than this now
2020-07-23 21:36:34: > 100% agree, most Xbox one x games look better
2020-07-23 21:59:50: > @MegamanZero410 lul thats what i saw the first time it was revealed and i still do. 343 lmao
2020-07-23 22:19:16: > 30fps good graphics < 60fps
2020-07-23 22:25:30: > @ShintyShinto "roblox visuals"
2020-07-23 22:26:00: > I'm a high end pc gamer and i tell u now, the graphics are great!
2020-07-23 22:36:22: > The graphics are amazing its just that its not being pushed to its limit because of it also having and Xbox One port, but as least it runs 60 FPS
2020-07-23 22:45:04: > @Formula Apex You have 117 likes. Niiiiiice.
2020-07-23 22:56:05: > Graphics looked surprisingly rough, not impressive at all.
2020-07-23 22:59:40: > Honestly it just looks like they revamped the original graphics to 4k and added some new features. Not impressed and I love Halo.
2020-07-23 23:05:49: > Trace6x then why did Ratchet and Clank look better?? 
2020-07-23 23:05:56: > @Formula Apex released in 2 months?.... more like 5, good math bud.....
2020-07-23 23:45:45: > Its probably still in polishing phase tbh
2020-07-23 23:46:39: > Looked like an Xbox One game to me
2020-07-24 00:11:06: > @ريان الشهري "Press ... to start the DEMO"
2020-07-24 00:24:12: > This doesnt even look as good as an Xbox 1 X
2020-07-24 00:34:26: > Exactly Xbox suppose to be more powerful than ps5 but ps5 exclusive graphics look way better than what this showcase showed
2020-07-24 00:43:00: > Newniverse Interactive this man doesnt understand what beta means 
2020-07-24 00:43:46: > ريان الشهري I want to know how blind u are
2020-07-24 00:50:33: > @Trace6x how when better looking games still exist. Esp on pc
2020-07-24 00:53:52: > If you are still expecting the giant leaps in graphics weve experienced during previous generations you are gonna be disappointed. Technology isnt advancing as fast as before.
2020-07-24 01:26:44: > Yeah they need to start showing stuff that will make people want to buy the system. Well at least the part of the fanbase that prefers graphics over framerate.
2020-07-24 01:37:09: > Halo Infinite was shown running on the Xbox 1 X, not Series X.
2020-07-24 02:51:26: > Look at forza it was 343's Choice to make it look like that they didn't Focus on graphics but on gameplay.
2020-07-24 03:02:14: > Because it was designed with the original Xbox One as it's weakest link.
2020-07-24 03:29:21: > I thought the same thing but I think its just the style of art that halo goes for. Almost cartoonish type style, like destiny since thats Bungies style.
2020-07-24 03:37:47: > Did you see those animations? Pretty sure that was the Xbox 360 version...
2020-07-24 04:17:10: > guys if you think the graphics aren't good MAKE THEN YOURSELF THEN.
2020-07-24 04:39:28: > @OnlyForF1 Ratchet and Clank will not be available at the end of 2020. Maybe end of 2021
2020-07-24 04:41:13: > @Malik Coleman only one game look better Ratchet and clank. They other was CGI, even horizon 2
2020-07-24 04:43:25: > 12 teraflops and 120 fps right? Lol
2020-07-24 04:44:55: > @Rares yeah because we work for the billion dollar franchise.
2020-07-24 04:49:33: > everything literally looks the same dude sad
2020-07-24 05:03:34: > @Anas M Yeah normally I would. I was just pointing out that the selling point for this system (it's been focused on power..let's not kid) seems to be already falling apart.
2020-07-24 05:08:16: > Everything looks so smooth......kinda like destiny
2020-07-24 05:40:14: > The pop in at 7:07
2020-07-24 06:18:15: > Depends you can only watch 4K on pc not mobile, mobile YouTube only allows 1080p 60
2020-07-24 11:43:59: > @Jaime Villarreal Xbox 360
2020-07-24 16:55:53: > @Bovine Aviation more like u hope
2020-07-26 14:39:24: > vvvVFANGSVvvv haha 265 now  wonder why 
2020-07-23 18:56:33: Bad conf. Now you have to sell the console very cheap
2020-07-23 18:58:24: I guess for halo if it aint broke dont change it
2020-07-23 18:58:47: Looks amazing so many great games. Halos graphics slightly disappointed me but loved the gameplay
2020-07-23 18:59:23: Awesome!!!
2020-07-23 19:00:16: After this video I'm less excited 
2020-07-23 19:00:23: Halo Infinite looks promising, but that grappling hook better stay out of multiplayer.
2020-07-23 19:06:10: > hey better then armor lock
2020-07-23 19:29:50: > Thats exactly what I was thinking too lmao
2020-07-23 19:50:48: > Grappling hooks in multiplayer games can be really fun tbh, they add mobility and make the games faster paced. Look at Pathfinders grappling hook in Apex Legends for example
2020-07-23 21:36:38: > Honestly that makes me want it more. lmao
2020-07-24 11:39:20: > Why?
2020-07-23 19:01:13: 40K?! <3
2020-07-23 19:01:16: THIS SHOWCASE SUPPOSED TO HAVE MIC DROP MOMENTS?! PFFT!
2020-07-23 19:01:35: Im so disappointed
2020-07-23 19:24:15: > The only games I liked was fable and state of decay
2020-07-23 19:41:51: > Isaiah Sheppard teasers btw. The ingame graphics its what disappointed me
2020-08-02 09:03:37: > Then Cry.
2020-07-23 19:01:37: Destiny 2 vibes
2020-07-23 19:01:49: my mind.
2020-07-23 19:02:03: Awesome
2020-07-23 19:03:01: Halo looks so good! Cant please everyone I guess 
2020-07-23 19:18:32: > Its still 5 months away and people make it sound like its coming out tomorrow
2020-07-25 04:38:06: > Yeah, I can't wait. Trolls are just gaslighting it to get reaction so don't bother with them.
2020-07-23 19:03:16: The hype machine went to 11 this year, but the box only goes to 10...
2020-07-23 19:03:27: None of the games shown seemed to be bad at all but it definitely felt lacking in variety and didn't show some stuff that it should have. But honestly surprisingly decent. Good job Microsoft.
2020-07-24 14:40:52: > Dasher Ink yeah I didnt realise how good some of the exclusives are
2020-07-24 17:04:29: > "felt lacking in variety" - yes I see what you mean that 40k game looks exactly like that little people in the garden game and they both look like that hellblade game. They are all so similar....
2020-07-23 19:03:48: Too many cinematics
2020-07-23 19:06:37: Halo infinite look like nova mobile
2020-07-23 19:06:53: When I saw Jack Black I tought they were announcing "Brütal Legend 2".... Not complaining about "PsychoNauts 2", but another "Brütal Legend" would have been awesome.
2020-07-23 19:22:35: > So did I 
2020-07-23 19:38:32: > I knew they wouldn't but still cried.
2020-07-23 22:05:30: > sadly the IP belongs to EA afair, so that will never happen.. but this Level (?) looks awesome. ^^
2020-07-23 22:29:46: > dude 100%
2020-07-24 02:57:02: > I was hoping that too 
2020-07-24 04:32:45: > he was wearing the brutal legend shirt
2020-07-24 12:48:26: > @GViRuS84 Brutal Legend belongs to Double Fine.
2020-07-24 15:46:11: > Love Jack Black, but that game was complete shite.
2020-07-24 17:38:04: > Oscar Galicia yea bro, I know right like so much not looking good games this time
2020-07-27 08:38:08: > Good call
2020-07-31 04:20:29: > You know how happy I am to see more people wanting another BL Game?
2020-07-23 19:08:28: Xbox definitely overhyped this event
2020-07-23 19:42:41: > Phil did,that will teach them not to believe PR....
2020-07-23 20:03:00: > They always do and xbox fans always fall for it
2020-07-23 20:19:44: > Paco Gonzales I mean the ps event wasnt anything to write home about either o.o I feel meh for both. There were some games that looked alright and the same could be said about this event too. well at least to me both events werent that stimulating.
2020-07-23 22:01:24: > Microsoft should fire all the cretins running their Xbox division and replace them with people that actually know what they're doing, Sony's already won the next generation and it hasn't even started yet LOL.
2020-07-23 22:08:29: > @Diego Guevara look at the online engagement. Ps event was far better. Plus they didn't over hyped it or promised gameplay like xbox. We only got halo gameplay.
2020-07-23 23:23:37: > Super underwhelming event, even dissapointing
2020-07-24 01:06:48: > I'm starting to believe their marketing doesn't get video games. Somehow they have recorded this after watching PS5 reveal.
2020-07-23 19:11:45: I gotta say some of these graphics look amazing
2020-07-23 19:11:51: Everwild looks gorgeous 
2020-07-23 19:23:38: > I can careless for ever wild
2020-07-24 01:12:00: > @Isaiah Sheppard   Looks way better than Horizon 2.
2020-07-23 19:11:57: Halo Infinite bouta go craaazy!
2020-07-23 19:12:47: Are you able to transfer your Xbox one account over to the Xbox series X. I'm guessing yes but I want to make sure
2020-07-23 19:13:24: > Of course
2020-07-23 19:21:14: > Yes you will
2020-07-23 19:12:54: If the storys good Ill play it
2020-07-23 19:13:50: 2:45 it's my birthday from 540 years from now
2020-07-23 19:13:58: Cant wait for phyconauts
2020-07-23 19:14:32: Halo! Halo! Halo!
2020-07-23 19:15:52: Started weak ended strong
2020-07-23 19:57:21: > Claude you talk now?
2020-07-23 19:58:52: > Global Occult Coalition when did I talk
2020-07-23 19:16:19: Phantom Dust 2 when???
2020-07-23 21:47:15: > Probably never, man. I'm just as disappointed as you but it's a lost cause..
2020-07-23 19:16:40: Why would flight simulator not be in here, its probably the most impressive game on the system
2020-07-23 19:31:39: > Andrew Dotson because the trailer was already out?
2020-07-23 19:51:25: > I grew up watching my dad play that game and hoped I'd see it here. Oh well, still getting both of us Series X's. See you in the skies.
2020-07-23 20:13:16: > They already showed that
2020-07-23 20:31:08: > Because its not an xbox game. Its for PC
2020-07-23 20:33:10: > Probably because it's for PC, and this showcase was for upcoming console games.
2020-07-23 20:33:44: > @DavidInPuyallup It's an Xbox game as well....
2020-07-23 20:56:36: > SteffanRD its all fun and games until you crash into your home lol
2020-07-23 22:16:59: > I haven't seen any official mentions that it will be on xbox
2020-07-23 22:40:32: > @Alex J. They said it will be on Xbox one...surprised they haven't mentioned the new system yet
2020-07-24 00:36:55: > Yea I don't get it, it's their biggest IP.
2020-07-24 00:50:46: > look at the 5th panel at 14:20 dudes
2020-07-24 02:34:43: > I can't believe how many people liked this guys comment and apparently though MS Flight Simulator was an Xbox game. 
2020-07-24 02:46:12: > @Vivisect it's coming for Series X as well
2020-07-24 07:54:41: > @Chris S. its not
2020-07-24 08:40:18: > for real, idk why they're showing these goofy cartoon games
2020-07-24 10:28:16: > @3ggbrain Its coming for xbox later this year
2020-07-24 19:15:30: > Not enough time for every game.
2020-07-24 20:28:57: > Youre on drugs
2020-07-24 20:32:31: > It's out in like three weeks, so it would be kind of redundant. They can't make the show infinitely long.
2020-07-26 05:48:08: > Vivisect its coming to Xbox check out the website
2020-07-28 14:38:43: > @DavidInPuyallup its coming to xbox series too
2020-07-28 16:58:50: > Its for both PC and XSX pretty sure idk bout X1
2020-07-28 17:35:22: > @19HRTBRKS It's coming to Xbox One as well
2020-08-17 18:59:38: > @DavidInPuyallup it's voming yo xbox
2020-07-23 19:17:04: all dislike and express your disagreement and the angry ones that are with this disappointing event. RIP XBOX continue in your third place.
2020-07-23 19:17:19: Nah its all good bros you showcased this on the 360
2020-07-23 19:18:41: Im not sure how I feel about the halo trailer. It does look fun. Its only in beta so only time will tell.
2020-07-23 19:43:46: > Play doom eternal it look exactly the same
2020-07-23 19:46:01: > its not out in 2 months? what can they do lol
2020-07-23 20:01:45: > @Botito geming 
2020-07-23 20:15:36: > @Botito geming like 4 months...
2020-07-23 19:18:52: Halo still looks like halo 4&5 thats lame.
2020-07-23 19:24:16: > Because bungie did not do it
2020-07-23 23:31:03: > ESOTERIC SAGENESS Thats a shame because Bungies Halo looked 10x better.
2020-07-23 23:33:24: > @TheKing0fHalo and played better with more action. 343 killed the storyline.
2020-07-23 19:19:04: STALKER 2 Console Seller!
2020-07-23 19:21:22: 44:18 DAN RYCKERT!?

2020-07-23 23:01:52: > Joshua Espino  You are welcome 
2020-07-23 19:21:46: So far, only Fable and Avowed seem very interesting.
2020-07-23 19:21:47: I watched so i could decide if im gonna buy ps5 or xsx... Im getting ps5
2020-07-23 19:22:12: > I swear to God
2020-07-23 19:53:31: > I mean the ps5 game show reveal was pretty meh as well
2020-07-24 02:24:29: > Or save up and buy both. Then you don't miss out on anything.
2020-07-23 19:22:50: Lets go!!!! 
2020-07-23 19:23:23: Underwhelming as I predicted
2020-07-23 19:40:17: > It was ok,lets see how many will believe phil PR from now on tho....
2020-07-23 19:43:12: > Thank you for your prediction mr industry insider
2020-07-23 19:24:43: Did you guys just put up Xbox 360 launch video by mistake?
2020-07-23 19:25:19: I actually loved almost every game and the graphics look amazing and I dont think they have even shown the true power of the Xbox series x yet!
2020-07-23 19:32:49: > How do you know what the games will look like tho? Halo was literally the only gameplay and it looked like Halo 5
2020-07-24 03:12:24: > @TheHornedUltimatum You need to watch it again. Plenty of games had gameplay. Crossfire X, Tell Me Why, and several others I forgot the name of.
2020-07-23 19:25:45: Fable!!!!!!!! 
2020-07-23 19:59:20: > Aw yeah baby!
2020-07-23 19:25:51: Man Can't wait to play Tetris on the XSX
2020-07-24 16:06:13: > This but unironically
2020-07-24 19:30:00: > 4k 120 fps for sure
2020-08-13 22:54:28: > Can't wait to play bugsnax on the PS5
2020-07-23 19:27:03: Can't wait to see the improvements with Elder Scrolls Online!
2020-07-23 20:33:51: > ????? you mean avowed ?
2020-07-23 19:27:17: TV Sales are about to go crazy this year. Better start ordering those 120HZ TV's now folks before they're all gone.
2020-07-23 19:48:19: > I'll just use my 300 dollar 1080p whatever 
2020-07-23 19:54:25: > Most TV's are at least 120 hz
2020-07-23 20:00:43: > Almost all tvs since 2018 are all 120hz and 4K....
2020-07-23 20:15:58: > Like they don't make more?
2020-07-23 20:24:02: > @NSX 55 You live in an alternate universe.
2020-07-23 20:35:22: > they can make them fast enuf, do not worry1
2020-07-23 21:48:57: > So your telling me that I won't be able to use my 24" matsui crt TV?
2020-07-23 22:43:48: > But LG said they can't run AR full bandwich ^^ so not trur 4k/120
2020-07-23 22:53:54: > Tactify24 most TVs are 60 hz.
2020-07-23 22:58:49: > none of these games will run at higher than 60 fps lmao chill
2020-07-23 23:05:22: > Folks make sure you buy the HDMI 2.1 TVs and nothing else.
2020-07-23 23:07:37: > @gregor clegane Most won't, but the Ori dev said it'll be 120fps. It was in the showcase.
2020-07-23 23:59:21: > For what? For Tetris?!
2020-07-24 09:48:22: > trent82 you live in poverty my friend. How sad.
2020-07-24 15:47:31: > Yeah to play indie games......
2020-07-24 15:48:26: > @Tactify24 oh really in what year in the future u live in Mr. Time traveler?
2020-07-23 19:28:09: why does halo look like an xbox 360 game
2020-07-23 20:05:12: > Cuz they suck at graphics
2020-07-23 20:06:03: > youboob1996 IKR LMAOO
2020-07-23 20:06:17: > it's your internet speed probably
2020-07-23 20:08:52: > 360? more like gamecube.
2020-07-23 19:28:20: Ps5: x's, squares, circles, triangles  XboxX: 14:00 *xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx*
2020-07-23 21:38:04: > x gon give it to ya
2020-07-25 17:06:50: > The Xs have taken over the world
2020-07-23 19:28:20: Only game play was halo. All the rest were just in game. Obsidian looked the best.. Out of everything...Can't wait to play on game pass.
2020-07-23 19:30:18: This isn't 4k60
2020-07-23 19:31:20: Stalker 2 and Fable. Nothing else.
2020-07-23 19:31:22: Forza clip was very misleading.. the car scene was definitely not ingame.. Overall, very disappointing show of games.
2020-07-23 19:35:33: > It says In engine, not In game, but yeah I was hoping to see in game footage
2020-07-23 19:31:46: Sorry but with this video Microsoft just put the last nail on their coffin. RIP Xbox im changing to ps5.
2020-07-23 19:50:52: > Who asked?
2020-07-24 03:09:50: > Right? Like Gamepass isn't making them money hand over fist.
2020-07-23 19:34:00: Boring...
2020-07-23 19:34:05: Very woke with the protagonists in every game
2020-07-23 19:35:46: I LOVE THE  GAMES YOU HAVE SHOW, but I would like to see some Gameplay
2020-07-23 19:36:00: S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 stole xbox conferences !!!!!!! Fantasic climat !!!! 40:00
2020-07-23 19:36:44: The big baddie for Halo Infinite didn't look realistic at all. Master Chief looks awesome as does the guy with him, but the big bad guy just look cartoonish
2020-07-23 22:43:15: > Hes a brute, theyre literally giant space apes. Theyve pretty much looked like that since Halo 2.
2020-07-23 22:55:31: > Imo I think halo infinite has good graphics when it comes to master chief and the guy, but the actual map/world still looks like its stuck on Xbox one.
2020-07-24 02:24:03: > @DeLiRiOuS 300 Likely because Master Chief and the guy have had the most texture work done to them. You can see some of the assets are very high quality compared to others. It just shows they're saving the upscale texture work for last
2020-07-24 08:53:07: > It has nothing to do with the graphics its the art style
2020-07-25 17:51:40: > @Jose Lara moron
2020-07-23 19:37:01: Disappointing
2020-08-02 08:33:07: > Then Cry.
2020-07-23 19:37:45: Halo plays and looks alot like Destiny...  Hyperius looks kind of lame lmao why does he look so human?
2020-07-23 19:46:13: > I was thinking doom eternal
2020-07-23 21:25:38: > Destiny plays like halo wtf
2020-07-24 02:31:36: > @Kerninja the Frog Its true because the team that originally made Halo went on to make Destiny and some of that original team stayed on with 343 to continue making Halo. That would be why they play similar. Its also how you know that he knows absolutely nothing about Halo.
2020-07-25 18:06:47: > Also, Brutes have always looked bland in the franchise, all the way back to Halo 2.
2020-07-23 19:38:28: Nice video   Stay safe   Watching on the re run up to 57:00 tonight
2020-07-23 19:39:24: Xbox wins.
2020-07-23 19:39:48: "Captured in-engine" yeah but on PC hardware lol
2020-07-23 19:49:19: > Crazy I know. Xbox SERIES X now has PC hardware.
2020-07-23 20:14:05: > Consoles are PC hardware, genius.
2020-07-24 02:01:19: > Like the PS5 footage wasn't also captured on PC hardware...what do you think they develop the games on?
2020-07-23 19:41:11: Obsidian <3
2020-07-23 19:42:51: Cant wait till the August event
2020-07-23 19:42:56: "The Best lineup of next generation games"  bro y'all need to chill out, I can't stop laughing now
2020-07-23 19:44:13: 52:44 X gon' give it to ya
2020-07-24 04:17:04: > wha!!!
2020-07-23 19:44:14: Stalker and halo look epic
2020-07-23 19:44:46: Im tired of the kiddie art style games.
2020-07-23 19:47:27: > but their better than your super serious grey and brown mud simulators.
2020-07-23 19:52:21: > It's the only thing that's gonna run at 120fps
2020-07-24 03:02:51: > So out of the three that were in this presentation which do you dislike the most?
2020-07-26 18:09:12: > @ash fair lol gimme an example fanboy
2020-07-23 19:46:09: I like fable and helblade 2 :)
2020-07-23 19:47:18: Thanks for showing the Halo Infinite demo running on xbox 360
2020-07-23 19:50:39: > Nah more like original Xbox 
2020-07-23 19:53:32: > @K13RANW3AV3R05 I agree with you
2020-07-23 19:47:34: 25:10 So ant bully the game
2020-07-23 19:48:20: state of decay 3 .. ️
2020-07-23 19:48:26: Wait yal are dissapointed??? wtd did you want,people impossible to please stg. Good shi xbox cant wait for fable
2020-07-23 20:31:05: > I know right, everyone seems so eager to judge
2020-07-23 19:48:30: I'm content. Good job xbox.
2020-07-23 19:49:17: Fantastic! Fable at the end too? I've waited forever for another Fable!
2020-07-23 19:49:49: Well at least Skyrim will run slightly better there's that 
2020-07-23 19:50:59: Ignore dislike and comments. The studios of xbox have all likes and mine have our respect to yours success.
2020-07-23 19:52:22: The dislikes are coming from Ps fanboys
2020-07-23 19:52:32: AAAANU CHEEKI BREEKI IV DAMKE!!!
2020-07-23 19:55:36: Not impressed at all, and Ive owned an Xbox since 2001. PS5 might be my new system this time around. I got stung with the xb1.
2020-07-23 20:08:41: > PS5 aint impressive either.
2020-07-23 19:59:36: Fable looks great, and double-fine 2
2020-07-23 19:59:58: Xbox just won.
2020-07-23 20:00:31: 40 minutes of video and still waiting for the great exclusive Microsoft games I was hoping...
2020-07-23 20:13:53: > well... Maybe The Medium and the new CrossfireX campaing be good... But...
2020-07-23 20:04:11: This event was truly magnificent, so many games to play alone and with my friends.
2020-07-23 20:05:03: Nice one Xbox You Are On Fire #moreplease #xboxnipower #xboxispower
2020-07-23 20:05:19: Wow. Everwild looks stunning!
2020-09-27 07:31:16: > Lol really?
2020-07-23 20:05:22: 4k hdr 120fps will of the wisps. im sold
2020-07-23 20:06:59: All these bots liking this 
2020-07-23 20:16:38: > Ok
2020-07-23 21:27:05: > Imagine being so pathetic to judge what someone likes
2020-07-23 21:33:28: > Kerninja the Frog imagine being offended by this comment.  snowflake
2020-07-23 20:07:06: It honestly feels like none of the games shown are even close to being finished...
2020-07-23 20:16:45: > Even Halo doesnt really look finished
2020-07-23 21:06:21: > Especially Hellbalde 2 Senuas Saga....Epic said the Unreal Engine 5 will have its early version released in 2021....strange
2020-07-23 23:23:22: > What about the games that are literally already out on current hardware?
2020-07-23 23:55:08: > They are just being held back by the restraints of having to run on the aged xbox 1.
2020-07-24 00:25:00: > at least it's gameplay, on ps5 most of it seems cinematic.
2020-07-24 00:27:56: > @Ranger20492 Do you know that corporations often get tech early?
2020-07-24 01:10:42: > Oof ps5 have gameplay (Unreal engine 5 demo, granturismo,ratchet and clank,kena and the bridge of spirits,oddworld,hitman3) and many more
2020-07-24 08:17:46: > Its a reveal trailer, the games arent meant to be finished when theyre revealed
2020-07-24 08:35:28: > @A Bit of an Animator someone with sense.
2020-07-24 11:50:36: > @Cristian Vitola what gameplay? I only saw Halo gameplay, please enlighten me
2020-07-24 16:05:35: > S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 looks amazing  If you played SOC, Clear Sky, Call of Pripyat           AHHHHH NU CHEEKI BREEKI IV DAMKE
2020-07-24 16:43:05: > @Ranger20492 big difference in what they tell the public vs companies. So you're say that with too much confidence like you sit in this boardroom meetings.
2020-07-24 18:11:28: > Because they aren't lmao
2020-07-25 05:53:12: > So like the ps event?
2020-07-25 06:36:50: > at least, they'll be finished before Yandere Simulator and Star Citizen.
2020-07-25 07:22:11: > Total GAMIX I mean, those werent finished either but at least seems to be further in development.
2020-07-25 07:38:12: > @ne0tic how's that? Spiderman only showed like 5 second trailer and their car game had tons of pop ins and bad graphics
2020-07-26 03:17:42: > @Cristian Vitola there's gameplay in the trailers on Kena bridge of spirits,Ghost wire tokyo,Rachet and Clank,Solar Ash,Godfall Did you not watch it mate?
2020-07-26 03:18:24: > @Total GAMIX dude ^ read here
2020-07-23 20:07:28: Xbox Series F(ail) , 99 tera FLOPS
2020-08-02 08:32:10: > Cockroachstation 9Tfps.
2020-07-23 20:08:39: Very good show, can't wait to see more of Fable, Everwild, Hellblade 2, Forza
2020-07-23 20:09:56: This was straight doo doo
2020-07-23 20:10:49: I wonder what happened between he loved us when he found us in the reveal trailer
2020-07-23 20:11:08: *GTA5 PART 3 IN DEVELOPMENT LETS GET HYPED*
2020-07-23 20:12:54: Im not into console wars but I think Xbox outdid Ps5 *edit Im not high I can have an opinion but if you think I cant then good for you
2020-07-23 20:19:29: > Wut !!!
2020-07-23 22:26:56: > How many bongs did you do before watching this?
2020-07-24 03:17:34: > As far as titles that interested me, PS5 showed more however, this was Xbox's best presentation in years. I was actually excited for most of what I saw
2020-07-26 18:06:47: > Are you high? People are more interested in getting the Ps5 instead of the series x
2020-07-26 18:51:28: > Enrique Martin Chales bro I can have an opinion that not many people agree with, I have the freedom of speech dude
2020-07-23 20:13:02: so many Snoys in here downvoting xD
2020-07-23 20:13:54: The Last of Us : Marlene Edition
2020-07-23 20:14:05: Well I'm Soaked 
2020-07-23 20:16:27: FM8!!!!!
2020-07-23 20:17:00: Just Halo gameplay, and the rest of the show was just bunches of trailers with tiny glimpse of gameplay ..AGAIN ‍️...where was HellBlade 2 gameplay? ... this show was meh, quite boring to be honest, and that Halo infinite demo was not impressive at all, graphics are meh...Maybe because I am playing Ghost of Tsushima right now.  Still gonna play some of what i saw on my PC tho.  On the positive note , Medium looks nice , and looking forward to see what this Fable gonna look like
2020-07-23 20:18:28: > Jesus aren't you pretentious.
2020-07-23 20:18:08: *T  E  T  R  I  S*
2020-07-23 20:18:22: Cartoon lookin Halo.
2020-07-23 20:19:24: The Obsidian games, hellblade, Fable and Rare's game all look great. I can't wait for 2020 to be over. Edit: and Pychonauts too, obviously
2020-07-23 20:21:56: These games look ready for Xbox one.
2020-07-23 20:23:33: there was pop in, in Halo infinite...
2020-07-23 20:45:16: > I saw it, too
2020-07-23 20:45:24: > Noticed too, in the elevator scene.
2020-07-23 21:03:40: > the game launches in the holiday, there's a lot of time to get it fixed.
2020-07-23 21:18:18: > That means it's legit actual gameplay
2020-07-23 21:34:18: > They should fix it but its still bad.
2020-07-23 21:43:50: > There was pop in in Gran Turismo 7 on PS5 as well, but neither of these games have finished development yet
2020-07-23 22:20:33: > You cant complain until the game comes out
2020-07-23 23:25:17: > @Carson Davis GT7 was announced to run @ 120fps with Ray-tracing.
2020-07-23 23:32:55: > Yeah some grass popins too but that'll get ironed.
2020-07-24 08:02:07: > And one instance of stutter.  Maybe due to loading or autosave process that hasn't been streamlined or polished up, yet?
2020-07-24 08:34:48: > Lol pop'outs' of grass, 5:00, I thought overall though the game looked decent , decent voice-acting, world, but considering it's space some jet boosters on the suit should be applicable.
2020-07-24 08:35:51: > If that was their best take then i don't want to know just how bad the rejected footage was.
2020-07-24 11:37:52: > I saw it and thanks for making me unsee it... they will fix it im sure tho. It releases during the holiday, they have time.
2020-07-24 18:15:40: > @Franzus Gütlus tbh, it was hard to miss
2020-07-24 18:15:55: > @TheEvolution_PT sssssure, whatever you say buddy 
2020-07-24 18:16:25: > @michael perez blind, pretty much?
2020-07-24 20:35:47: > @Carson Davis there wasn't any pop in in gran turismo 7
2020-07-24 20:38:35: > Joe Allen there was... Digital Foundry covered it
2020-07-24 20:48:38: > @nowonmetube to what? I don't get it.
2020-07-24 20:53:46: > @michael perez seriously??
2020-07-24 21:29:56: > NewAgeMan yea... and both games will get fixed anyway
2020-07-25 05:14:44: > So many pop ins
2020-08-01 10:55:01: > @flegoron now where have I heard that from?
2020-08-17 22:17:58: > @TheEvolution_PT well i guess 6 months about right
2020-07-23 20:23:36: I wanna play the Xbox Series X right MEOW!
2020-07-24 03:03:46: > LOL now I'm thinking of Stray on PS5 :)
2020-07-24 03:08:45: > mmuspmdiv I'm thinking about Halo 
2020-07-23 20:25:10: This console ain't it anymore. Even after 15 years of loyalty.
2020-07-23 20:25:23: "I'm very excited now!"
2020-07-24 01:33:10: > "Me too!"
2020-07-23 20:26:03: Im ready
2020-07-23 20:26:54: FM8!! YESSSSS! ‍️ DONE GUYYYY!!!
2020-07-23 20:39:52: > What's the Jamaican connection?
2020-07-23 20:28:41: Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.  These comments.
2020-07-23 20:29:03: The guy talking to Master Chief makes me want to stomp his face in repeatedly.
2020-07-23 20:30:21: was the new flightsimulator included?
2020-07-23 20:50:34: > Its not on XSX
2020-07-23 20:30:37: Why so many dislikes? I plan to get both consoles cant wait
2020-07-23 20:40:27: > Halo was súper dissapointing :'( it even hurt how bad that was.
2020-07-23 21:39:17: > Because it stunk
2020-07-23 21:48:27: > It was really underwhelming
2020-07-23 21:54:18: > Salty ps5 fanboys
2020-07-23 21:55:06: > I was getting both but after this showing Im not seeing any reason why to get series x on launch anymore tbh
2020-07-24 02:49:56: > @Otto Schmid What about it specifically was bad?
2020-07-25 16:08:02: > @docc19 graphics art style sound design pop ins. Lack of impact with gunfighting lack of anything really wowing me. Weird animations for ships flying making them look stiff and floaty. Shall i go on? I used to be the biggest halo fanboy ever since ce dropped... Its dead to me now. Least i still have the books.
2020-07-25 17:47:15: > @B B keyword: Demo. Also, H2 and H3 had plenty of situations where ships looked stiff and floaty but you didn't see anyone complain about it.
2020-07-23 20:31:50: 19:25 Leafos!
2020-07-23 20:35:13: Looks just dated. 60 fps are fine but I would prefer 1440p with checkerboard rendering instead of 4K with graphics from 2008.
2020-07-23 20:35:29: Why are ther so many dislikes?
2020-07-24 16:51:56: > Console Warz kidz and people that actually just didn't like the presentation.
2020-07-23 20:36:41: Can't wait to see how they add button prompts to these trailers to make them into video games worth £60 each
2020-07-23 20:38:55: Blinx 3 plis
2020-07-23 20:40:09: Zzzzz
2020-07-23 20:40:44: Halo
2020-07-23 20:44:30: I only know 3 games in this rip me
2020-07-23 20:45:25: FABLEEE!!!!!!!
2020-07-23 20:45:45: We love you Xbox Team <3
2020-07-23 20:49:55: Loved Phil Spencer's jacket. It's way of topic but does anyone now where to get it and what brand it was?
2020-07-23 22:21:06: > It looked casual but you can't afford it, trust me.
2020-07-23 23:35:46: > For real, great jacket.
2020-07-23 20:55:32: Now THAT felt like Halo!
2020-07-23 20:56:48: > How
2020-07-23 21:19:42: > @Firerat2000 that was more halo than halo 5 was
2020-07-24 02:17:15: > That was the same as every halo
2020-07-23 21:00:12: Right... Of course that's only my personal opinion, BUT Xbox haven't got so good launch showcase games since... ever. Finally something not only to match but outshine PS5 games showcase. I haven't seen that before. Well done MS!
2020-07-23 21:00:56: That one more thing!!!
2020-07-23 21:01:27: I'm going to buy the weakest nextgen console! I'm good with that!
2020-07-23 21:14:02: > ...Eh?
2020-07-23 21:02:21: xbox i am coming home thank you for game pass.
2020-07-23 21:05:25: This was way better than the compressed stream.
2020-07-24 00:50:45: > Yeah that was glitchy af
2020-07-23 21:07:11: Big difference between cross platform games vs the XSX only games (Stalker 2, warhammer, Medium). Phil are you sure the xbox one doesn't hold back your games?? You aren't lying do you?
2020-07-24 20:21:49: > Hes the Lying King lol
2020-07-23 21:08:34: Resumo da Xbox Games Showcase: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhc9P-JdrBw
2020-07-23 21:09:25: Just came for Halo tbh
2020-07-24 02:30:18: > Well, clean up the mess.
2020-07-23 21:10:35: So whens the showcase?
2020-07-23 21:11:44: well that sucked
2020-07-23 21:12:54: 2:45  My birthday 540 years later
2020-07-24 12:26:22: > birth happy you day to scooter
2020-07-23 21:13:11: Obsidian are killing it
2020-07-23 21:13:27: man, i cant wait for tetris.  X Gon give it to you
2020-07-23 21:13:56: You're bringing an already F2P game to GamePass? Thank you so much.
2020-07-23 21:30:23: > The expansions weren't F2P ‍️
2020-07-23 21:16:04: All the games looked amazing on my 4k tv lots of good games can't wait to play them
2020-07-23 21:58:50: > why get the xbox when you can play all the games on pc anyway?
2020-07-23 22:03:09: > @June Toon Because i'm console gamer
2020-07-23 21:17:41: I never thought I'll say this. But I can't wait to play state of decay 3 and finally hard conformation on Fable!. Let's go Halo infinite 
2020-07-23 21:17:56: HOT
2020-07-23 21:18:08: Can't wait to play all those games I'm ready!
2020-07-23 21:21:53: 22:42 dude just say 120fps
2020-07-23 22:42:55: > 120hZ means the same thing bud
2020-07-23 21:22:47: My favorite announcement was Everwild
2020-07-24 02:15:58: > Same
2020-07-24 05:44:03: > What's there to like about Everwild?
2020-07-24 14:49:21: > @PsychoticEmpathy magic
2020-07-24 19:29:47: > @PsychoticEmpathy the world exploration
2020-09-27 07:24:44: > @PsychoticEmpathy low graphics
2020-07-23 21:22:59: I can't wait to play so many of these!...    On my PC.
2020-07-23 21:27:48: > PCs are second class citizens
2020-07-23 21:23:42: Can't wait for Halo.
2020-07-23 21:23:45: Awesome
2020-07-23 21:24:58: Somebody has been playing Doom Eternal at 343...
2020-07-23 21:54:13: > ikr that grapple
2020-07-23 22:45:47: > Yes! It seems I'm not the only one who did double take lol Some of the abilities and certain aspects of movement look "inspired by" DE
2020-07-24 18:18:58: > And Destiny 2
2020-07-24 21:53:01: > @nowonmetube  I thought of Rage 2.
2020-07-23 21:26:08: The song at the end?
2020-07-23 21:27:25: So ahhhhh those infinite graphics aye
2020-07-23 21:27:33: the one game i wanted was fable and it was at the end yesssss
2020-07-23 22:29:37: > FABLE carried my childhood
2020-07-23 23:25:26: > god i have every fable game including the original fable except the kenekt game that was horible
2020-07-24 00:05:05: > Yeah Fable the only exclusive they have to show off that looks good. PS5 has so much more to offer exclusive wise
2020-07-24 00:10:37: > They only have Spider-man and Zero horizon we have classic game series like Fable and Halo and mabey another Perfect dark game ?
2020-07-24 00:49:51: > Fable really hit different, ive been waiting 10 years for thisssssss
2020-07-24 02:31:35: > @Billybear23 same
2020-07-24 03:33:35: > Hopefully we get gameplay next time... Can't wait to see what it's like
2020-07-24 10:07:35: > Manx Skurrie they also have demons souls
2020-07-24 11:01:14: > We got forza and gears of war
2020-07-29 02:09:59: > This whole thing was embarrasing. And after all the bs fron Phil all the way to the xbots just makes it even funnier.
2020-07-29 02:53:04: > @Danny Sandoval, what BS ?
2020-09-03 10:19:15: > Wait for only 3 years 
2020-07-23 21:27:40: It was ok, but Ill save my judgement until these games will be revealed (looking at you fable)
2020-07-24 09:42:21: > Seems like you've already judged, and came to the conclusion it was "OK." 
2020-07-23 21:28:01: Why´s nobody talking about Psychonauts 2? Am i actually the only one who loves Psychonauts?? :((
2020-07-23 21:30:13: I saw all this games on my 65" LG Oled and good lord I am ready let's goooooo
2020-07-24 00:38:10: > 
2020-07-23 21:32:42: I really didn't expect to see STALKER 2, but I loved SoC and CoP (and clear sky was okay) so in veeeery excited. I need more of the zone in my life.
2020-07-23 21:33:40: The pop in on Halo Infinite was really bad and very noticeable.
2020-07-23 22:52:54: > The pop?
2020-07-23 23:05:45: > shotgun on you
2020-07-24 19:21:05: > @Kevin Riehl He meant grass and other texture popping out mid screen.
2020-07-25 01:19:29: > I think the poor LODs and aggressive culling of foliage was very unsightly.
2020-07-25 01:52:21: > @Long Pham thanks man I appreciate it
2020-07-23 21:33:53: Thank you for the 4k Vod of it.
2020-07-23 21:35:04: Halo looks worse than some Xbox one X games lol...
2020-07-23 21:35:06: Only actual game play was halo right ?
2020-07-23 21:36:17: Just came here to leave my dislike. After being let down by what the ps5 had to offer i was hoping that microsoft would set the Bar. Let down once again none of these games aside from Halo are worth playing
2020-07-23 21:37:29: The XboX presentation sponsored by... "AND PC"
2020-07-23 21:40:10: Fey lives matter
2020-07-23 21:42:14: This was rubbish the only game I cared about was halo infinite this was bad PS5 has kinda won with games cause these game where just DLCs it's stupid
2020-07-23 21:42:42: Anyone got some time stamps?
2020-07-23 21:43:36: cnsole launch exlclusive oh wait its also coming to pc.. i don't think microsoft know what exlclusive means and yes i have to spell it that way otherwise my comment gets hidden
2020-07-23 21:47:00: > lol
2020-07-23 21:44:09: Why do the effects in halo sound so light? Wheres the density, the punch
2020-07-23 23:25:41: > I noticed that too, the sounds sounded off lol. Thought it was perhaps me or the stream. 343, isn't a top tier dev. They showed that with 4 and the debacle of 5 & MC collection.
2020-07-24 00:57:35: > The warthog sounded wrong to me, and the rest of it didn't thrill me. Makes sense if the audio wasn't great. I think Halo 4 & 5 killed my excitement for new Halo also.   :-/
2020-07-24 06:45:10: > It's in destiny
2020-07-23 21:47:46: Xbox ONe X?
2020-07-29 14:39:56: > Thx but i dont need 1 more pc

2020-08-18 06:32:43: > 500000000 dollar budget thanos
2020-09-18 18:10:35: > Nothing like thanos
2020-10-14 04:22:54: > Man that early build of the game looks like melted cheese.
2020-07-23 21:50:19: Amazing show
2020-07-23 21:51:44: Not as impressive graphics as I expected
2020-07-23 21:51:48: 4K version really better than GameAwards live
2020-07-23 21:58:56: I Miss scalebound 
2020-07-24 00:38:59: > Maybe one day itll get picked up again. Its happened before where games have been shut down and someone picks them up years later
2020-07-27 08:39:42: > You aren't alone

2020-07-23 22:15:41: Wow..What an Xbox , now I can play Mario Bross finally in 8K 60F
2020-07-23 22:16:37: I loved it! Here we goooooo
2020-07-23 22:17:52: L
2020-07-23 22:18:08: 
2020-07-23 22:18:50: State of the cay 3 yes
2020-07-23 22:19:19: Oh man. I forgot Jack Black had vocals on him like that. My bad. Also. Glad I decided to watch this. Looking forward to Halo and Forza for sure.
2020-07-23 22:28:22: > And TETRIS. HOW DID I MISS THAT.
2020-07-23 22:19:44: Halo looked like halo as it should be ️
2020-07-23 22:21:25: Are these all exclusives
2020-07-23 22:24:50: S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2
2020-07-23 22:24:59: Im happy with the event I see 12 games I like
2020-07-23 22:26:43: FABLE!! How I miss that saga
2020-07-23 22:28:10: Nah
2020-07-23 22:28:22: Pretty excited about fable
2020-07-23 22:28:44: Ubisoft r6 quarantine?
2020-07-23 22:32:52: If state of decay 3 really looks like that I might actually buy it.
2020-07-24 02:40:25: > It won't if it sticks to the gameplay formula of the first two, which I hope it does with expansions to the co op system, but it will still look good.
2020-07-23 22:33:09: Honestly love the grappling hook idea for mobility Some amazing actions could be pulled off with that
2020-07-23 22:37:00: Im glad halo infinite isnt what I was excited for. That way I was actually happy about SOD 3, Avowed, and of course Fable.
2020-07-25 17:50:28: > that's sad
2020-07-23 22:41:19: Everybody saving up for xbox...me, Im saving up to replace my old 1080i HD-Ready tv...-.-
2020-07-23 22:47:22: Okay, stalker got me hyped
2020-07-23 22:47:31: Fanstastic. I see lots of stuff I really want to play here. Best of 2020 so far.
2020-07-23 22:49:48: This almost to the letter follows BDG's perfect E3 presentation guide.  I know this from how many shots I took playing the drinking game.
2020-07-24 02:20:31: > LarLakFarStrider pretty much all showcase events follow the same exact guidelines. Its lame lol
2020-07-23 22:50:39: ps5 stream sits at 13 million views.  Its been 6 hours and this one hasnt hit 200K
2020-07-23 23:07:51: > Just wrote the same comment. That's pathetic. the PS5 video had millions of views after 6 hours.
2020-07-23 23:13:56: > Cause its was the console reavel
2020-07-23 23:17:05: > Jonhy Sins thanks for pointing that out, didnt realize it.  Love your content btw!
2020-07-26 17:56:07: > @Mad Joe I know right? that just shows that people are way more interested in getting the ps5 than the xbox series X
2020-08-02 08:25:17: > 13M rat boys.
2020-07-23 22:53:05: Lmao, the cyberpunk roast
2020-07-23 22:57:43: Well done Microsoft, love the showcase, take my money for the SexBox, this fan very happy
2020-07-23 22:57:46: Mjölnir exosuit...seriously!?
2020-07-23 22:59:38: The 4k hdr video looks good. What's wrong with the 1080p video? Looks like they converted hdr gameplay to sdr in video editing instead of playing in sdr. Smh.
2020-07-23 23:00:12: Halo infinite just looks stunning! Honestly cant wait till Christmas so I can get my hands on it.  However will the AI stand still that much or are they playing on super easy?
2020-07-23 23:01:13: 4:04 "I know I saw Clone Wars over there" It's the Halo - Star Wars crossover we've all been waiting for
2020-07-24 00:52:30: > He said condors in the subtitles but yes it does sound like that
2020-07-24 01:36:50: > I knew the graphics resembled something I remembered. Star Wars clone wars!
2020-07-24 04:52:46: > bruh hahaha
2020-07-24 08:09:47: > hahahahah
2020-07-30 20:29:45: > I knew I wasn't the only one....lol
2020-08-02 04:42:55: > If you think of condors he says condors but if you think of clone wars he says clone wars my head hurts bro
2020-07-23 23:04:28: FANTASTIC Show definitely getting the Xbox after PS5
2020-07-24 04:21:42: > why after?  why not just buy both?
2020-07-24 04:39:54: > @tawilk don't feel like stripping my wallet
2020-07-24 15:40:53: > Global Occult Coalition Me Too.
2020-07-23 23:07:44: Compared to the PS5 showcase, the graphics are extremely disappointing. Anything that looked particularly good wasn't even gameplay footage.
2020-07-23 23:08:44: Staler 2 remaster blew my mind (though for sure will play that on PC), and Fable was great though been wanting it for so long that i kinda was just like "Finally". lol
2020-07-23 23:09:53: Could we see 120 Hz in multiplayer for Halo?
2020-07-24 04:17:30: > Probably at 1440p
2020-07-23 23:10:21: Whats happening with xbox live?
2020-07-23 23:13:19: I'm done with Xbox
2020-07-23 23:14:44: Great show of games and Fable <3
2020-07-23 23:15:23: Ps5 won
2020-07-23 23:15:57: Ill say it the Halo graphics aint what I was hoping X would look but definitely looks awesome to play.
2020-07-23 23:56:13: > Yup, graphics were quite underwhelming to me. Looked bland, and lacked detail imo. There was pop in as well.
2020-07-24 00:37:42: > I was hoping the prerendered graphics would be what the gameplay looked like. Very underwhelming
2020-07-24 01:05:44: > I mean It looks more realistic than halo 5 but forza  looked real
2020-07-24 01:10:16: > I think they look better in the thumbnail or picture in the store than they do in the trailer Id see them looking better when I actually play the game
2020-07-24 01:26:03: > I think they focused on what series X can do for gameplay, not graphics.  So bigger battles, more enemies, more large scale wars, bigger maps, etc. I think it's the right choice for halo
2020-07-24 01:27:32: > they still havent finished it tho i mean we are barely half way through the year they might release new gameplay later along with the trailer
2020-07-24 01:40:27: > @bleesev2 for that to be true then it wouldn't be playable on the original Xbox one. It's gonna play the same as that version so the series X will only be offering better graphics and performance. Once they start making series X exclusives then you'll get the features you mentioned.
2020-07-24 01:44:46: > Halo has never had cutting edge graphics, not sure what you were expecting. When Halo 3 launched, Bungie said that they could have made it look much more realistic but then it wouldn't have been Halo.
2020-07-24 08:17:31: > Need this for run 4k 60fps
2020-07-24 08:33:50: > Bruh the games graphics will be refined when it comes out you seriously expect to look like that? ‍️
2020-07-24 08:57:55: > Even the Gameplay and the Open World Apects Were Pretty Meh TBH.
2020-07-24 11:01:43: > speed cooler considering this Game has to run on Xbox one yeah, theses graphics aint gonna be much better
2020-07-24 11:20:19: > That gameplay was recorded months ago apparently. So its still in alpha
2020-07-24 11:25:25: > @bleesev2 Halo 2 already done that dude...
2020-07-24 11:25:30: > Looks like the previous Halo games. Bright cartoony graphics and even tech wise, shadow quality, texture detail and even object/texture pop in was visible
2020-07-24 12:56:33: > It will be better on the seres x
2020-07-24 15:06:18: > Graphics underwhelming, but gameplay looked great.
2020-07-24 15:52:21: > Apollyon Rev911 I just want the blood painting the floor like Halo should be
2020-07-24 20:30:29: > They used old footage. Wait until launch to see everything
2020-07-25 14:12:38: > I think this generation will be more about performance and level design than graphics.
2020-07-25 23:38:38: > @sabin10 Umm.... Halo 1 and 2 had cutting edge graphics for the time.
2020-07-25 23:39:08: > @speed cooler Stop being so naive. The game will look EXACTLY like what you saw in this video.
2020-07-26 07:34:08: > AquaFinaX halo 5 looks better than halo infinite
2020-07-28 17:34:21: > Guys, the game's not finished yet. Cut them some slack!
2020-07-30 02:58:58: > The demo was of an old build they were going to show at e3, until it got cancelled.
2020-07-30 04:22:02: > paulshawn3345 excuses
2020-08-02 04:08:34: > Well its the demo so i think itll get better
2020-08-07 13:10:35: > @Kenshin Himura your probably right, sorry I dont know what I'm talking about, I just want the game to look good
2020-08-12 06:32:23: > You know we could just wait for the game to be.... I dunno, made before we judge it
2020-08-15 20:54:20: > 343 ruined Halo for me.
2020-09-24 14:43:44: > Apollyon Rev911 its supposed to look like old halo games.
2020-10-21 12:52:18: > It's not final
2020-07-23 23:16:31: Am I the only one that thinks Halo Infinite looks good?
2020-07-23 23:29:55: > Yes
2020-07-24 00:45:04: > Mad Joe wow
2020-07-23 23:20:00: Whats the name of the song at 55:14? Shazam cant find it
2020-07-24 01:06:05: > PORTALS "It Begins"
2020-07-23 23:22:51: flop 
2020-07-25 04:39:09: > Go play Fifa.
2020-07-23 23:23:46: Best console ever ️
2020-07-23 23:23:54: I am looking forward to Halo Infinite and State of Decay 3 the most. Can't wait!
2020-08-19 01:24:51: > Looking forward to Halo and Hellblade 2 the most
2020-07-23 23:24:17: Looks great. Looking forward to Avowed to fill the gap between Cyberpunk and Elder Scrolls 6.
2020-07-25 08:42:26: > That's a HUGE gap
2020-07-23 23:24:29: 10:28 Look those amazing graphics! it's totally worth
2020-07-24 04:15:16: > I guess you could go back to playing SOT where there are not character animations outside of fighting....
2020-07-23 23:24:47: Yes halo, yes fable, yes destiny... scrap the rest!
2020-07-23 23:26:28: The way he says "World Premiere" at 12:23 made me think I *gained the Lead*
2020-07-24 02:37:22: > Flag Dropped.
2020-07-24 03:10:39: > @Mike McCall _Killing spree_
2020-07-25 04:27:59: > Flag taken.
2020-07-25 09:24:15: > Slayer...
2020-07-23 23:26:49: Xbox should be called the PC Engine in Japan.
2020-07-23 23:28:07: Xbox strategy ? Sell game pass...
2020-07-24 04:04:07: > so you play games.... shocker!
2020-07-26 19:39:12: > Yes, and?...
2020-07-23 23:29:15: bruh I knew they were lying about fable
2020-07-23 23:29:32: mic drop
2020-07-23 23:31:03: Lmao much love to who ever made the trailer for grounded!
2020-07-24 04:57:10: > If you're waiting for the biggest game of the year...  Then wait for Cyberpunk 2077!  Gold.
2020-07-29 07:40:55: > Now here have the smallest game. It costs 479GB to download!
2020-08-02 17:49:03: > The grounded trailer reminds me of the stanley parable trailers
2020-07-23 23:31:33: 'Best graphics in the industry' and 90% of these games are just brown and grey.  Literally the only interesting thing here was psychonauts and outer worlds dlc.  idk maybe fable.  Every shooter in this showcase looks like same boring game.
2020-07-23 23:32:25: I miss being excited for destiny but now I'm completely done with the series, it's never been as good as it was with taken king.
2020-07-24 07:38:50: > Forsaken was better !

2020-07-23 23:37:52: Wow XBOX disappointing fans another level
2020-07-23 23:38:58: When i see the event now it's so much better and different.  Maybe it's time to stop the streaming event. The poor quality does not make justice to your games !
2020-07-23 23:39:17: About the graphics.... remember your watching this on YouTube.
2020-07-24 09:32:00: > please, dont

2020-07-23 23:46:44: I am disappointed at halo already :/
2020-07-23 23:46:45: These games... 
2020-07-23 23:47:52: Halo infinite looks amazing!!!
2020-07-23 23:50:14: Wheres the last of us??? God of war??? Spider man???? Uncharted 5???? Little big planet 4???? Master chief for smash??? This was not worth it
2020-07-23 23:50:27: Holy cow! YES! Let's go!
2020-07-23 23:51:05: Gotta throw in the strong diverse female protagonist of course. Cause diversity duh.
2020-07-23 23:51:19: Really like some of these new titles, Xbox has really listened to the player base. Can see my self getting lost for months in these
2020-07-23 23:57:16: I so did not at all expect that STALKER 2 reveal
2020-07-23 23:57:52: All about that "diversity" huh? You can keep it.
2020-07-23 23:58:59: Obsidian has done loads wow big fan of the new RPG
2020-07-25 00:50:02: > They didn't even show anything of the game
2020-07-23 23:59:18: Awesome .
2020-07-24 00:00:20: 90% indies games, which I will never ever play.
2020-07-24 00:32:31: > and thats why the "powerhouses" will continue to give us mediocre games.  Indie doesnt always mean bad.
2020-07-24 00:33:42: > bruh most of these games were from Xbox's main studios they aren't indie games
2020-07-24 02:21:56: > Ok thats great, bye bye
2020-07-24 00:00:56: SEGA
2020-07-24 00:01:25: We better start ordering 120Hz TV's... For Tetris!!

2020-07-24 00:14:47: 7:06 frame rate issues hahah   the power of the xbox lolololololol
2020-07-24 00:16:09: Ps5 and Xbox game the same
2020-07-24 00:17:47: I already have the X paper weight, I think I'll skip the X ashtray.
2020-07-24 04:09:33: > ok pony boi, please let the door hit you on the way out.
2020-07-24 00:18:30: Halo looks amazing
2020-07-24 00:30:02: > Are you serious?
2020-07-24 00:19:10: Thanks Xbox for the warning for the medium not gonna sleep now scary!
2020-07-24 00:19:37: Fable! Yes!
2020-07-24 00:20:09: Finally they show actual gameplay
2020-07-24 00:21:30: I saw chernobyle and i was like STALKER 2????
2020-07-24 00:22:07: The grass was just disappearing in the halo trailer. Trashy af
2020-07-24 00:22:31: I mean the games looked good but if you're only buying one console, the series x it shall not be.
2020-07-24 01:33:03: > Yeah I'm leaning toward PS5 at this point. I've enjoyed the xbox one x but I think I'm going to be jumping ship when the ps5 comes out. I only buy one console.
2020-07-24 01:42:27: > well then get used to playing remakes and remasters
2020-07-24 10:04:06: > Gabriel Garcia and Xbox series x wont have them? xD
2020-07-24 10:59:18: > Osvaldas Paslauskas yeah, but Microsoft doesnt over hype them.
2020-07-24 20:01:18: > mmuspmdiv if you actually enjoyed the One X prepare to be blown away lol
2020-07-25 00:54:39: > @Smash Kids it's called marketing you degen
2020-07-25 01:34:13: > @Gabriel Garcia  ok bud because that all they have remakes and remaster sold over 100million consoles
2020-07-25 02:31:30: > Gnome ok its called overhyping and letting everyone down you incel.
2020-07-25 15:51:31: > @Gabriel Garcia get used to cell shading and cartoon graphics being the "next generation" for you.
2020-07-26 03:23:18: > @Gabriel Garcia umm hello? All of your exclusives are mostly sequels
2020-09-16 01:05:58: > @Myntrix Ratchet and Clank, Spider-Man, Horizon, Oddworld, Sackboy, and Gran Turismo.
2020-07-24 00:24:40: 2020 60fsp lmao, why are you so proud of 60fps, slideshow gamers?
2020-07-24 00:33:27: > wierd flex but ok

2020-07-24 00:30:37: S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2 
2020-07-24 00:30:48: LOL they managed to edit out the 30 minutes of dead air countdown and upload this new version of the #XboxGamesShowcase then! Well done!
2020-07-24 00:31:35: Wow muy astutos, lo están dejando todo para dar el golpe final, bien pensado.
2020-07-24 00:32:40: Im sorry but personally I was not impressed whatsoever. Will be switching to ps5 this generation
2020-07-24 00:33:20: ‍️Seriously Xbox !?!?
2020-07-24 00:33:58: How do we make YouTube URL links that go directly to the HD version, now that they've broken the "&vq=hd2160" method!?
2020-07-25 01:59:39: > Goat Lips  nobody cares
2020-07-25 11:47:12: > 1. vq argument has iframe embed, not video url 2. player ignores it if iframe size lower than vq-size
2020-07-24 00:36:32: Meh... forcing wahmen into gaming, blatantly obvious, most of these games are mediocre and not for the majority of gamers.
2020-07-24 00:38:48: Omfg I'm so excited!! I'm so proud of Microsoft!!!
2020-07-24 00:39:36: Ive been with xbox since day one looks like back to ps
2020-07-24 00:41:04: Rust ?!?!
2020-07-24 00:43:04: SOD looked great, but wasn't gameplay. Same for Forza.
2020-07-24 00:46:03: Everwild artstyle looks really interesting, same feeling i got from little devils and kena.
2020-07-24 09:23:51: > Something about that art style just resonates with me, I think its super beautiful
2020-07-24 12:58:40: > Both games have special art style, just like Zelda botw
2020-07-24 16:31:58: > Breath of the Everwild
2020-07-24 17:39:29: > Glen Bodino you got some wrong in your eyes
2020-07-24 00:50:45: Ps5 has won
2020-07-24 00:55:36: Incredibly show would have loved to see more of SoD 3 Hellblade 2 and Fable though
2020-07-24 00:56:03: So its Spider-Man vs Tetris 
2020-07-24 05:25:02: > I'd play Tetris over Spiderman any day ‍️ lmao
2020-07-24 14:42:41: > angel99joe aight man i love tetris but even if i was as high as snoop dogg I wouldnt play tetris over spiderman. That Xbox mentality
2020-07-24 00:56:42: XSX > PS5
2020-07-24 00:58:07: 27:23. Finally, skyrim 2 electric boogaloo
2020-07-24 04:01:22: > given Obsidian's track record, it will be crazy good w/ a lot of depth, customization, and adult humor.  can't wait!
2020-07-28 22:11:53: > Skyrim but awesome 
2020-07-31 05:06:52: > The only reason skyrim was ever relevant was like all Bethesda Games, the modding community. Atleast New Vegas was enjoyable without mods, so this new game could be interesting.
2020-07-24 00:59:52: Batman? Pls launch batman. I hope the leaks are true
2020-07-26 18:04:05: > Their not.
2020-07-24 01:02:28: Games on my radar in this order from most favorable! :D   1. Fable 2. Senua Hellsblade 3 Forza 4. Everwild 5. Avowed 6. Phantasy Star online 2 7. The Medium 8. Halo Infinite
2020-07-24 01:51:43: > Yup!
2020-07-24 02:02:05: > How could you forget flight simulator?
2020-07-24 11:17:00: > Yeah also Tetris too
2020-08-02 08:18:10: > State of Decay 3, STALKER 2, and SCORN.
2020-07-24 01:02:56: Man, Halo looked amazing! So colorful and crisp, yet still realistic and gritty. I can't wait to play it.
2020-07-24 03:03:37: > It literally looks like the previous halo games  stop lying to yourself
2020-07-24 01:03:39: Marine: "Were outgunned, outnumbered" Chief: I like those odds
2020-07-29 07:43:30: > *Mando has joined the chat.*
2020-07-24 01:04:20: Forza did not need to be shown here. We knew it's coming - show us when you are ready. Hyping it up and resorting to in-engine smoke & mirrors hurt it. Stop talking about console power - show it.
2020-07-24 01:08:26: Let's be real, has anyone ever played Halo for its graphics?
2020-07-24 01:08:41: Any games with men......WTF
2020-07-24 01:13:01: 6:48 starting weapon from destiny
2020-07-24 01:20:25: Most PS5 games will be 1440p 30fps and they're in the comments talking smack?  #TheNerve
2020-07-24 01:58:33: > Shh...just reality slap them across the face on launch day!
2020-07-26 12:53:17: > 4k60fps on SM miles morales and on Demon souls
2020-07-26 12:55:08: > Hey will you shut up if you don't know how the games would run because it's really embarrassing
2020-07-26 17:39:21: > Bruh its already confirmed that spider man miles morales , and Demon souls will run on 4k/60fps. These xbots are running out of excuses lately.
2020-07-24 01:24:21: PLAYGROUND GAMES I LOVE YOU
2020-07-24 01:27:30: Does anyone else not like the '117' on Master Chief's armour?
2020-07-24 01:53:07: > It's a soft reboot so I kinda see what they were going for but I don't really like it either
2020-07-24 01:34:20: Xbox Series X price = PS5 Price - $50.00 PS5 Price = Xbox Series X price - $50.00
2020-07-26 12:52:39: > That desperate huh?
2020-07-24 01:35:44: Lol L
2020-07-24 01:36:18: Halo Infinite looks very underwhelming graphically to be honest. Just proves MS was lying when they said new games won't be held by by supporting older consoles.
2020-07-24 08:54:27: > Its the art style, so its not really based on graphics
2020-07-24 10:39:29: > @Jose Lara Bruh... low quality textures and pop ins are not "art style".
2020-07-25 17:50:13: > @R A It's a Demo. None of y'all seem to realize or understand that.
2020-07-26 17:37:55: > @Trunyx Bruh the game comes out in 5 months, i highly doubt they are gonna fix something big, and considering Covid 19 slows down the production of the game, I don't think halo wouldn't even look insane unless they delay it.
2020-07-24 01:37:27: Great show.
2020-07-24 01:39:44: I might buy ps5 just might
2020-07-24 01:43:13: Thats boxer from white lines with MC 
2020-07-24 01:43:56: This was so freaking good. Working on my reaction video immediately!
2020-07-24 01:45:24: Gotta day, Im pretty hype for grounded
2020-07-24 01:46:56: Overhyped
2020-07-24 01:47:50: Disappointing
2020-08-02 08:16:44: > Then Cry.
2020-07-24 01:48:59: "Tell me why" kinda gave me chills
2020-07-24 06:36:50: > Interesting, it's really not my type of game but I am confused why they use this to show of the series x. It's looks strange
2020-07-24 06:58:42: > Toby Robinson yeah, the facial expressions are pretty bad
2020-07-24 01:49:20: Nobody:  World Premier Guy: "World Premier"

2020-07-24 01:51:49: THIS WAS AMAZING I AM SO EXCITED 
2020-07-24 01:52:17: I liked Avowed :) I wished they would've showed more gameplay of that and Forza.
2020-07-24 01:53:50: Halo looks amazing but i wish there was more gameplay of other games
2020-07-24 01:55:43: still lame... mic dropped
2020-07-24 01:56:28: Over 100 games eh? Are any of them good?
2020-07-24 01:59:05: 12 teraflops for this? WTF u kid me Xbox? lol
2020-07-24 02:03:31: Don't you like first person shooters? Because that's all you'll get
2020-07-31 03:02:45: > Its all the west knows how to make.
2020-07-24 02:04:20: I think its very stupid that some people still do console wars. Everybody can play on any system they want to play on. Also Im very excited for forza Motorsport 8.
2020-07-25 17:05:43: > Its a competition lol why wouldnt there be console wars
2020-07-25 17:43:38: > It's been going on for generations bro.
2020-07-25 18:14:56: > @Zabreya Goins It's a competition for the companies not the consumers.
2020-07-24 02:05:20: Not gonna lie, was suuuuper disappointed until I saw the new fable game, HELL YEAH!
2020-07-25 11:10:04: > Its just an mmorpg with the FABLE name attached to it, its not an actual fable game
2020-07-25 19:33:46: > @StrayGamer wrong it's been stated its an action rpg with online elements such as co-op. For all intents and purposes its not an MMORPG.
2020-07-24 02:07:57: I wish halo didnt look so animated
2020-07-24 02:09:51: Why not 140fps?
2020-07-24 02:12:10: World Premier  cue Kid Rock music video
2020-07-24 02:13:23: Halo loooks so good

2020-07-24 04:49:52: > Peter Lestelle halo. Thats it.
2020-07-25 19:59:24: > Clearly it was tetris
2020-07-26 05:51:34: > Errr... Forizon, Stalker 2, Halo Infinite, State of Decay, Fable I can go on u know
2020-07-26 12:48:27: > @General Grant but you would run out so easily
2020-07-26 12:48:58: > @General Grant what are games on the xbox that aren't coming to PC?
2020-07-26 23:07:30: > @Myntrix what games on the ps5 wont be playable on PC?

2020-07-25 14:38:26: > It was CGI bullcrap. Its probably never coming out.
2020-07-24 03:05:24: This show was saved by Halo.....
2020-07-24 03:06:44: 43:15 Should've started the presentation with this from the beginning. Would've sold the audience much earlier.
2020-07-24 03:08:13: All trailers should be realtime nowadays.
2020-07-24 03:09:33: Love it
2020-07-24 03:11:16: gotta admit, the gunplay, juggling enemies, it looks almost as fun as doom eternal!..

2020-07-24 03:31:40: Yeah thats 13TF for u smh
2020-07-24 03:37:02: If Microsoft were doing good for the past 10 years. This show would have been 6/10.  They havent been good , they desperately needed to get people excited and they dropped the ball as usual 0/10.
2020-07-24 03:41:21: 25:10  I waiting for this funny product 🤏
2020-07-24 03:47:14: Every single time I see the Avowed trailer I get Lord of the rings feels

2020-07-24 03:48:52: Pretty disappointed with halo. didn't really have that halo look or feel but i am really excited for stalker 2. Also the obsidian studios games look great.

2020-07-24 04:32:32: This was so bad its not even funny
2020-07-24 04:55:06: > What exactly was bad?
2020-07-24 16:41:57: > Total GAMIX everything about it

2020-07-24 05:11:47: This looks so much better than the video they streamed....
2020-07-24 05:25:32: Pathetic
2020-07-24 05:35:04: After watching this event I am 100% sure that ps exclusives are the best
2020-07-24 06:42:00: > Yes dude 
2020-07-24 06:52:42: > Ok, and we care?
2020-07-24 06:54:47: > Do you realize how long it took PS to get their exclusives matured????
2020-07-24 07:03:20: > @Anmol Sandhu if we can afford any one of the console then these things have to be taken care of. What will I do with such power if it doesn't have good games in good quantity.
2020-07-25 04:56:57: > And you just figured this out ‍️
2020-07-26 17:28:58: > Ps always had better exclusives than Xbox. These sad xbox fanboy are jus mad because they know it's true.
2020-08-07 17:19:42: > Enrique Martin Chales ok your exclusives are good, now leave us alone
2020-07-24 05:38:36: can we please have FOV options in all games now
2020-07-24 05:39:25: As Dusk Falls looks interesting
2020-07-24 05:39:39: 25:05 That was actually kinda funny
2020-07-24 05:39:47: Best PS5 ad
2020-07-26 12:38:45: > Actually persuaded me to buy one
2020-07-24 05:41:25: I have tried so hard to like Xbox but they just don't make games I want to play 
2020-07-24 05:50:45: Medium will be so great. I live it
2020-07-24 05:58:05: Im gonna watch this video on 144p
2020-07-24 06:00:25: Avowed , Stalker 2 , Fable and Forza look interesting. Too many unnecessary games though.
2020-07-24 06:06:36: Pso!!! Finally
2020-07-31 04:18:05: > The upgrade was necessary. I love it :)
2020-07-24 06:16:56: Halo Mobile. Minecraft Edition.
2020-07-24 06:20:10: Xbox came prepared. Can't wait to play dark tide....
2020-07-24 06:21:42: halo infinite  the poor mans doom 2016

2020-07-24 06:24:27: Lets back to 360
2020-07-24 06:29:53: Uhhh i have both consoles. There are so much more better games coming on PS5 then XBox.. like dude new Halo game graphics look like Xbox 360.... disappointed
2020-07-24 06:32:07: xbox series x   vs     playstation5                           Round one     fight   playstation5.    Wins
2020-08-07 17:22:15: > Ok if you got the attention you needed, then leave
2020-07-24 06:33:38: Amazing!
2020-07-24 06:37:05: Underwhelming as hell. Ill just stick with my PC for now.
2020-07-24 06:37:47: I'm not an Xbox fan but gotta say Microsoft actually knocked this one out of the park.
2020-07-24 07:07:58: > "Xbox fans" and "Microsoft fans" are different
2020-07-24 06:37:48: :/
2020-07-24 06:40:43: None of which what was shown will matter once the Ps5 arrives, after seeing how meh halo infinite looked it proves it.
2020-07-24 06:48:06: i'm sorry but most of these games are wack.

2020-07-24 10:59:44: > Chill out its not even done yet.
2020-07-24 17:27:12: > @Smash Kids it releases in like 5 months, you must not know how development time works, it will look practically the same in December (and I'm not even taking into consideration how Covid slows the development process).
2020-07-25 16:04:08: > @Smash Kids you are so cringe bro.
2020-07-24 07:10:30: Yall are excited for this? Lmao Xbox plebs
2020-07-24 15:15:52: > Can I not see PS fans in the comments... FOR FIVE MINUTES!

2020-07-24 07:11:41: Ok I am excited! Cyperpunk 2077, Halo Infinite, state of decay, forza, STALKER.2, and FABLE, oh my god. Next generation will be awesome!
2020-07-24 07:18:44: Halo infinite looks like it was made in forge. Halo 5 looked better at times.
2020-07-24 14:28:51: > The gameplay demo was from an build made in January.
2020-07-24 14:48:41: > @Shcott Goggle proof?
2020-07-24 16:10:39: > I do agree it looked rough but gameplay looked awesome. Guns seemed to have weight to them etc and how the enemies responded was awesome like how you could shoot off there armor etc.
2020-07-24 07:26:00: Huge L for Xbox
2020-07-24 08:57:23: > Hd Tap Why?

2020-07-24 07:33:50: Nobody not gonna mention the awesome remix for the intro?
2020-07-24 07:34:21: Im not as excited as I would have been in the past.
2020-07-24 07:40:05: Halo infinites kinda giving me destiny vibes  idk seems kinda phresh
2020-07-24 07:40:40: Happy overall but needed more gameplay. And were was Cuphead, flight simulator, Eden ring, Hell blade 2 gameplay and Battletoads. I really hope they show more on the august show.....

2020-07-24 08:46:54: XBOX X? Do you guys not have PCs?
2020-07-24 08:52:26: The Medium looked interesting.   The rest was just boring.

2020-07-24 09:14:36: @TeamXbox : Thanks for all, it's amazing :)
2020-07-24 09:17:09: Can someone explain the dislikes to me?
2020-07-24 10:27:13: > PS fanboys.
2020-07-24 09:18:07: I have goosbumps when that guys said Fight hard! Die will
2020-07-24 09:25:42: 4/10
2020-07-24 09:26:44: Dissappointed.... Bye xbox.. ;(
2020-08-02 08:08:30: > Then cry.
2020-07-24 09:27:01: I give this show 4 tflops out of 12
2020-07-24 09:27:01: 500M for Halo Infinite????? Qué habéis hecho con el dinero??????!!!!!!

2020-07-24 09:28:19: I dissapointment. Xbox RIP. Thanks Spencer...
2020-08-02 08:06:54: > Then cry.
2020-07-24 09:31:13: Big yikes
2020-07-24 09:34:29: That was sooo bad
2020-07-24 09:40:52: idk Halo felt very weak
2020-07-24 09:43:36: Yeah, I liked that! State of Decay 3, Fable, that's enough for me! I'm happy!
2020-07-24 09:47:56: Halo infinite = destiny 2.0
2020-07-24 10:01:48: Fantasy Star whaaaa!
2020-07-24 10:08:39: so CONSOLE LAUNCH EXCLUSIVE means these games will be on PC (or on PS5 at best)  later after some time (like 3 months after xbox launch)?
2020-07-25 10:55:36: > PC on day of launch and PS5 the following month
2020-07-24 10:14:36: Why does Halo look so cartoony? it looks like someone mashed fortnite and halo 5 together, its odd
2020-07-24 11:36:01: > It looks like halo combat evolved as it should.
2020-07-25 17:52:53: > @labrets halo CE came out 20 years ago. it's much worse
2020-07-26 03:57:47: > @bobsagget823 looking cartony isn't all about graphics, it's an artistic choice
2020-07-26 20:53:43: > 343i was pressured by its community to disavow and erase anything associated with Halo 5 guardians that included the art style. Nice homage to CE but does not show well visually.
2020-10-10 00:08:36: > Game looks so smooth
2020-07-24 10:46:19: Timecodes please ?
2020-07-24 10:49:26: FABLE I have only waited 10 years
2020-07-24 10:56:04: Stalker 2
2020-07-24 10:59:39: Man crossfire looks sooo silky smooth. Also looking forward to trying my first phantasy star game. Cant wait for vacation to jam on some impressive looking new titles. Heres to hoping for new experiences for all gamers this year on xbox and ps5!
2020-07-24 11:23:59: Amazing, thanks for everything Xbox
2020-07-26 11:48:52: > If You Think It Was Amazing, You Might be Kinda Slow.
2020-07-26 11:55:55: > @Captain Fantastic You must be great at parties. Also, if I'm the slow one, at least I know how to use capital lettering. Smh
2020-07-26 12:21:39: > @plonka2000 If you think it was amazing, you might be slow.
2020-07-26 12:24:16: > @plonka2000 Look at Your Username. You Really Know How to "Capital Lettering"
2020-07-26 12:25:38: > @Captain Fantastic Ha! Got nothing better than... "well, look at your username!".  Pathetic.
2020-07-26 12:27:17: > @Myntrix Thanks, you get my thumbs up for teaching Captain Fantastic here how to write correctly. 
2020-07-24 11:30:49: Imagine playing Microsoft Flight Simulator on the Series X tho... don't know why they didn't show it
2020-09-18 00:38:34: > Its nothing special, even the 2080ti struggles to run that badly optimised game
2020-07-24 11:33:34: wowwww
2020-07-24 11:38:00: Xbox = Unseasoned Chicken

2020-07-24 11:57:33: I really laughed by the grounded trailer 
2020-07-24 12:02:50: July 24th, dislike ratio @ 4.9k out of 16.9k = 29% dislike ratio lol  Man, you guys dont understand what gameplay means eh
2020-07-25 17:57:13: > cry boomer

2020-07-24 12:26:31: only 2 games i'm looking forward to playing hopefully they bring out more soon
2020-07-24 12:35:35: Microsoft did amazing, you guys are insane. Yes Halo looked very "meh" I'm guessing it was pre Covid build and they'll put the shine on it for the next showcase. But overall, very good very good!
2020-07-24 12:43:56: Meh
2020-07-24 12:50:03: What's the intro song name?
2020-07-24 12:51:54: wOrLd PrEmIeR

2020-07-24 13:40:03: 48:08 nice t-pose
2020-07-24 13:47:08: My favorites are halo and crossfire
2020-07-24 13:54:53: PS5 has way better games than Xbox, hands down
2020-07-24 13:57:54: One hour of trailers and then there "one more thing" that makes the whole hour worth watching on it's own.
2020-07-24 13:58:17: nothing interesting to me. except for halo fan boys. games these days are lacking something
2020-07-25 11:16:43: > Its called depth of field. Theyre all too sharp. Not very cinematic
2020-07-25 20:09:37: > @JTProductions3 Check Ghost of Tsuhima. Specially the cutscenes rendered in real time. They look totally cinematic.
2020-07-26 23:00:15: > You're just getting old lol
2020-07-27 09:41:12: > @Waiz 02 whatever fortnite

2020-07-24 15:07:44: Why are people still talking about console vs console? I grew up with Genesis vs SNES, N64 vs PS, GameCube vs Xbox vs PS2.. etc. But now I'm grown up and don't have to ask my parents for one or the other then bash the one I didn't get lol. I just do some overtime and get both. I feel old now 
2020-07-25 17:53:03: > ok boomer
2020-07-24 15:16:41: After watching this, I seriously cannot wait to order my PS5 
2020-07-24 15:18:03: Weak
2020-08-02 08:03:04: > You're weak.
2020-08-02 14:42:43: > Anonymous Hack You Easy not as weak as the presentation
2020-07-24 15:24:17: Microsoft and its never-ending condescension strikes again. Please... Keep using that 90's blockbuster trailer voice to tell your audience what they're watching [since you don't seem to believe that they can read] and exactly which adjectives best describes what's on screen. Also... Keep hitting that same talking point about controller latency [since you have the absolute slowest brand-name controller on the market]. OK... Just one more... Keep tilting your heads back so we won't see your [most likely stress-induced] double-chins; looks super comfortable and natural.

2020-07-24 15:33:32: Nice suicide microsoft, the last one.
2020-07-24 15:38:41: Uhm... Pathy's grapple and Bloodhound's scan on my spartan. YES!
2020-07-24 15:39:11: Xbox game pass might be the best thing to happen to gaming since gta went 3rd person
2020-07-25 11:24:58: > I dont think so 
2020-07-24 15:45:00: 500 millions
2020-07-24 15:45:53: Ori at 120fps... my god.
2020-07-24 15:51:54: Very bad trailer
2020-07-24 15:56:05: Welp Xbox lost...AGAIN LMAOOOO
2020-07-26 17:10:57: > LMAOOO
2020-07-24 16:17:05: I think these shows Live you lose something. The 4k 60fps Video posted after does look and feel better than the Live Stream to me.
2020-07-24 16:26:35: 53:51 Rareware logo ... could this mean possible new Conker's Bad Fur Day game?
2020-07-24 16:30:08: Meh
2020-07-24 16:31:53: That was..... "MEH"
2020-07-24 16:38:49: satisfied
2020-07-24 16:45:57: 2:22 gives me goosebumps everytime 
2020-07-24 16:57:54: Xbox Series X : FPS edition
2020-07-24 17:17:03: crossfire looks like splinter cell in my option
2020-07-24 17:19:30: the console might be powerfull and all that, but what if the games are just mehh  not worth the upgrade imo
2020-07-24 17:28:23: Anybody else waiting for the new call of duty games for series x
2020-07-24 17:36:00: Will my wife let me buy the xbox series x? Or ps5. Thats the question.
2020-08-02 09:20:44: > Xbox Series X!.
2020-07-24 17:37:16: 25:09 Лучший момент ))
2020-07-24 17:40:38: I can't believe dude said Xbox will go toe to toe with PS5 launch lineup haha... So biased
2020-07-24 17:41:29: Iz
2020-07-24 17:47:09: I LOVE WATCHING MOVIE TRAILERS THANK YOU XBOX !!!
2020-07-24 17:58:23: 5.1k people obviously never played S.T.A.L.K.E.R        HYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYPPPPPPPPPPE
2020-07-24 18:10:49: Halo was lookin like some parts were made in forge. Looked blocky in some parts of the map. Mine-crafty
2020-07-24 18:10:52: Phil Spencer, what happened to your "XbOx sEriEs X iSn'T bEiNg hElD baCk" statement?
2020-07-26 13:59:40: > Probably the same thing that happened to his "performance gap" statement
2020-07-24 18:12:25: Imagine loosing your shield on normal mode.
2020-07-24 18:17:59: Halo was lookin like some parts were made in forge. Looked blocky in some parts of the map. Mine-crafty
2020-07-24 18:20:53: I guess the new Xbox wasnt as powerfull as they promised or the games graphics were poorly focused on.
2020-07-25 07:21:42: > If you wanna know that was in old build from 2019 343i already confirmed that
2020-07-25 13:00:26: > JahonCross oh my bad I didnt know that.I woke have thought it was the new graphs Ive because its in 4K 60FPS.Its just seems to be world building but it will be better because its a walrus built as you mentioned
2020-07-25 15:50:52: > @JahonCross then why show that for the xbox reveal dawg? Its weak regardless
2020-07-24 18:20:54: If Halo was gunna rip Doom soo very obviously why not throw in some kill moves like doom's "rip & tear"?
2020-07-25 15:54:12: > Because they are "original" 
2020-07-25 16:15:28: > @B B maybe we'll get lucky and itll get revealed later...?
2020-07-25 16:27:06: > @Hank Skorpio maybe but at this point its not enough. Halo alone was usually enough to convince me to buy the next console. This time its convinced me NOT to.
2020-07-24 18:25:47: Yo anyone else hype for both the PS5 and the XSX?
2020-07-24 18:25:57: 2020: 2010 but with better graphics
2020-07-24 18:41:04: Most of these games are boring
2020-07-25 15:07:32: > rectec theyre not meant to be for everyone. Its a variety. Family games? Check. Action Games? Check Racing Games? Check Creepy Games? Check.
2020-07-24 18:49:13: How I felt watching the halo gameplay 34:21
2020-07-24 19:47:30: > Lol, underrated comment.
2020-07-24 18:50:23: I wanted the xbox series x cause the system itself looks stronger then the ps5, but these games look so boring to me.
2020-07-26 12:03:39: > They don't differ much in specs but in games...they really do
2020-07-24 18:51:40: Halo Infinite looks like another Remaster of Halo 1.......not what I was expecting, but seems more fun than Halo 5.
2020-07-24 18:53:28: You had the opportunity to show gameplay reveals for major games and totally missed the point. Fable can't be that far away that you don't even show gameplay ? I am disappointed honestly.
2020-07-26 22:54:59: > And Hellblade...
2020-07-24 19:03:10: They are still making halo ppl its not done yet the graphics may look better after its done
2020-07-24 19:14:19: Gorgeous
2020-07-25 10:45:29: > Hideous
2020-07-25 17:50:22: > StrayGamer  Let's see you do better.
2020-07-26 16:53:28: > @pizzahot "Shows Ratchet and Clank Pre Alpha Trailer"
2020-07-26 18:53:42: > @Enrique Martin Chales shows games that aren't even exclusives
2020-07-24 19:18:18: i like the game and i love what im seeing but i hope we dont stray tooo far from the path i dont want another halo 3 but i want what was in halo 3 everything else besides reach isn't cannon? its halo at the end of the day halo 5 wasn't even bad and i didnt mind 4 when it came out
2020-07-24 19:45:50: they hyped up the graphics too much. lots of areas where the texture are very low & others,not so much
2020-07-25 15:08:17: > Venik I mean textures and graphics are more easy to fix. It will look way better when its released.
2020-07-26 01:23:51: > The game isnt done yet
2020-07-26 07:42:43: > Winksopro i know its also 4 months old
2020-07-26 09:03:19: > Usually games get downgraded graphically after trailers and reveals, not upgraded tho
2020-07-26 18:53:19: > I mean they want to release it on all xboxes not just the series x
2020-07-27 17:20:57: > You can read "Optimazied for xBox Series X" Just chill :() This Build was from Januar
2020-07-27 22:37:04: > Beko who are you talking to?
2020-07-28 00:28:46: > Wasnt even played on the XSX
2020-08-07 20:58:22: > The game isnt finished dude
2020-07-24 20:16:59: Console exclusives? Guess I'll just have to get the PS5 and PC then, because the exclusives are not so exclusive.......
2020-07-25 07:20:43: > Ok and you're saying this because you wanna feel validated by?
2020-07-25 15:44:30: > @JahonCross ok and you're saying this because you wanna feel validated by?
2020-07-25 20:51:18: > You know that pretty much every PS "exclusive" will be available as well on pc right?
2020-07-25 21:08:15: > Thats fine, as long as youre subscribed to Gamepass, then Microsoft doesnt care
2020-07-26 03:04:24: > @Alessandro Barcaro not all like Xbox
2020-07-26 03:05:35: > there's timed exclusives but things like Uncharted , Spiderman , and god of war aren't most likely to be on Other platforms
2020-07-26 06:38:36: > Myntrix you should check ghost of tsushima.
2020-07-26 06:41:28: > @R3d Powel what about it?
2020-07-26 06:50:32: > Myntrix and compare it to ur Halo.
2020-07-31 15:32:59: > Cuphead lefted the chat

2020-07-24 21:12:56: Everwild BOW breath of the wild lol 
2020-07-24 22:04:31: 80% of the games are post apocalyptic. 
2020-07-24 22:16:23: @xbox, can you please tell me how to play all The halo games in order?, cause I havent played any and I want the story line to make sense when I do.
2020-07-24 22:21:12: Xbox should research on what the community want
2020-07-25 04:05:07: > The xbox community dont even know what they want lol, they're literally bunch of yes mans with Stockholm syndrome
2020-07-25 23:54:36: > GaMePaSs
2020-07-26 17:28:22: > Free multiplayer
2020-07-26 22:56:18: > @Anthony Viola at least its not COD/FIFA/GTA every year 
2020-07-29 12:45:23: > @Waiz 02 GTA every year you live in 2004 or you mean the GTA V trailer that nobody should care about?
2020-07-24 22:35:32: Halo looks much better on this upload Im watching in 4k to tho
2020-07-24 23:33:14: Can someone please tell me where i can find the outro song, i am going crazy.
2020-07-24 23:34:05: Xbox go home
2020-07-24 23:34:42: PSO lookin mad fine
2020-07-24 23:39:49: These game are exciting! I can't wait to play it
2020-07-24 23:44:27: Halo looks so dated next to modern DOOM
2020-07-25 00:02:03: 25:23    52:59   Cyberpunk 2077 confirmed for gamepass?
2020-07-25 00:07:02: 12 teraflops xd

2020-07-25 00:38:35: Great job Xbox!
2020-07-25 00:43:58: Yuhuuu fable.
2020-07-25 01:29:09: > Watch out for service elements.
2020-07-25 01:10:35: Are most of the games coming to Xbox pass on PC or just MS titles?
2020-07-25 01:34:04: FABLE FINALLY!!!!
2020-07-25 01:37:21: I wanted this to be good so badly :(
2020-07-25 01:39:11: OOOOH STALKER¡ <3
2020-07-25 01:50:10: PsychoNauts 2 looks so freakin Illuminati
2020-07-25 01:54:40: So it's obvious now that F2P games will be playable for Game Pass subscribers or Xbox Live Gold members. Rumors that Xbox will remove the paywall should be over now.
2020-07-25 02:38:38: pso2 bois here
2020-07-25 02:44:00: This graphics looks the same as Xbox one
2020-09-07 10:47:48: > Worse*
2020-07-25 03:02:41: 10:42 wtf
2020-07-26 17:16:47: > Yep. It's heartbreaking.
2020-07-25 03:02:42: Mediocre as usual Microsoft, loved how much "gameplay" we got to see in all these trailers.
2020-07-25 03:30:31: Disappointing disappointing.... STALKER 2!!! Wait...I hope they don't consolize it 
2020-07-25 03:32:43: Second hand embarrassment from that Brute speech It also looked unmodeled lol

2020-07-25 05:14:03: The original Crysis looked better than this Halo. LOL
2020-07-25 07:16:57: > Sorry to break it to you but it was an old build from 2019 343 already confirmed that
2020-07-25 10:42:01: > JahonCross ok budy whatever helps you sleep at night
2020-07-26 07:17:26: > @JahonCross the grass be disappearing tho 4:58
2020-07-25 05:23:50: State of Decay 3 ! The Medium ? Most of everything else freshly revealed: Ummmmmm.
2020-07-25 05:53:04: We are what, maybe 14 weeks from launch?   What are you even doing over there at Xbox?  Imagine how poorly the lack of concrete details/ real hardware/ real footage/ release dates/price would have played out on an E3 stage. There. Months. From. Launch.  Xbox still hasn't even shown enough real footage and real hardware to adequately prove that the entire project isn't **vaporware**, let alone something to get excited about. This was the chance.  This was the one shot to impress with first impressions.  Xbox blew it, again.
2020-07-25 06:00:39: wow they actually advertised tetris! im so excited for the new xbox exclusive games ! not!
2020-07-25 06:17:54: Can someone timestamp the brutes low rez closeup face everyones been sharing? Edit: nevermind i found it 6:34 lmao
2020-07-25 06:18:31: Waiting for Killer Instinct and Perfect Dark.. Rare needs to bring back more of its IPs, easily the most underrated studio at Microsoft
2020-07-25 06:50:57: PS5 lets goo
2020-07-25 07:15:26: Phil spencer : I've felt good about sony's conference! (cause ours gonna suck)
2020-07-25 07:51:57: Fable 
2020-07-25 08:03:09: Really liked the xbox showcase as expected
2020-07-25 08:17:55: Awesome
2020-07-25 08:23:07: I really miss those days when Xbox 360 gave some fair competition to PS3.
2020-07-26 07:32:23: > Same now PlayStations been dominating. Fun fact: PS2 has more sales than the Xbox, 360, and 1 combined
2020-07-28 01:10:08: > @Julio Menoyo xbox will still be my home
2020-09-29 17:15:29: > @Julio Menoyo here after bethesda purchase
2020-07-25 08:31:28: "Tell me why"... My thoughts exactly.
2020-07-25 09:41:25: lol what was the second trailer?
2020-07-25 09:48:20: Basically the whole video : Shooters Me : UGH Last game preview : Fable Me : "claping at 4:45am and wakes up family"
2020-07-26 19:27:43: > There was only 3 shooters
2020-07-28 08:25:26: > Awoved and everwild are great shooters
2020-07-25 09:49:33: Worlds most powerful console um ok
2020-07-25 09:53:53: 4:48, guys guys looks the floor, they just disapear when master chief walk on grass !!!  wtf
2020-07-26 11:49:32: > ?
2020-07-26 11:53:09: > @Joseph Julian Muscat he meant 4:58  Look at the sides bottom left
2020-07-26 14:26:47: > Clearly some severe issues with asset streaming, I want the series x but seeing that doesnt exactly sell you on velocity architecture or the ssd does it?
2020-07-27 01:11:26: > Work in progress.
2020-08-17 11:40:59: > @JozeManu delay in progress. 
2020-07-25 09:59:17: that's happen when microsoft make just 4K 60fps games...
2020-07-25 11:29:25: as someone that has been very medium and has had psychosis in the past i dont think i will be playing the medium game as it will give me flash backs of seeing shadow people and hearing voices.
2020-07-25 11:40:36: Microsoft, TAKE MY MONEY, there u go...
2020-07-25 12:16:01: So far Ive only seen the halo infinite story and bruh, let me tell you something.. that story intro was lit af 
2020-07-25 13:32:35: That Dontnod game has worse facial animations than Silent Hill 3 on the PS2.
2020-07-25 13:36:20: Halo Infinite looks like a 5 years old game at best.
2020-07-25 14:51:11: Ps5 definitely won
2020-07-25 14:56:32: Yo this video doesn't even go up to 4k xD
2020-07-25 14:57:41: Last of us 2 looks better than halo infinite
2020-07-25 15:14:08: better specs  better games
2020-07-25 15:20:08: Will it run Atlas at 60 FPS?
2020-07-25 15:34:43: who actually plays exclusives anyways, 99% of my games installed are 3rd Party Games
2020-07-26 11:51:37: > Ummm people that want to play them? I mean that's why some of them are GOTY
2020-07-25 16:30:30: Cnets 1080 showcases video did not do this system justice at all. Looks way better in 4k
2020-07-25 16:41:33: Halo looked like the game Im expecting to be this time
2020-07-25 17:40:19: There are only two games I wish to play, ori & stalker.
2020-07-25 17:41:01: They really tried to make their show like Ps5s, but failed badly. It just made it look cringe.
2020-07-25 18:32:19: This looks much much better. Thanks x box. Also keep these games day one on PC game pass
2020-07-25 19:21:48: HALO BAYBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
2020-07-25 19:24:58: Things are not looking good for xbox, sorry but its true.
2020-07-25 19:40:12: Genuinely didn't expect to see so many art assets popping into view in the Halo trailer. I thought that was meant to showcase the system?
2020-07-26 19:38:17: > Its not running on the series X, since its an old gameplay demo
2020-10-24 22:08:41: > It's also the demo. Literally says in the beginning, meaning it was running live.  At least they were honest about the current state of the game
2020-07-25 21:09:24: PS5 event took the level to high Nothing interested me too much but maybe 3 games
2020-07-28 21:57:16: > Bugsnax helped me decide what console's better
2020-07-25 21:42:26: Better than Nintendo's partner direct
2020-07-25 22:16:37: Xbox, don-not listen to those paid-critics, Keep up the good work, great presentation, i will be the first to get the Series x.
2020-07-26 07:09:46: > So the people are paid as well? Because this was underwhelming tbh
2020-07-25 23:03:26: the graphics look like playdough dude on yt over hyped xbox agants ps5
2020-07-25 23:23:08: meh
2020-07-25 23:26:10: you guys are killing your brand. should have stayed true to xbox green colors. why would you make the LED on xbox white? should have been green... so many things you are doing wrong Microsoft.
2020-07-25 23:37:32: The show case was very disappointing It's not worth the time I wait to say helo And when I did I wished that I haven't
2020-07-25 23:45:58: I really encourage everyone to try out Phantasy Star Online 2. Other than Halo, its the game im the most hyped about. Especially if you Like Xenoblade Chronicles X
2020-07-31 04:20:48: > Me too, it looks awesome
2020-07-26 00:11:55: Halo looks so good! I don't care what the naysayers think, I'm so excited!..like Jesse Spano!
2020-07-26 00:33:09: PC MASTER 4EVER
2020-07-26 07:07:18: > YeahGood for you whay specs do you have?
2020-07-26 07:08:19: > Cpu,Gpu, and RAM specifically
2020-07-26 00:58:48: I want all games to have the visual fidelity of the FABLE trailer. The character models, lighting, and animation are on point.
2020-07-26 01:20:56: This XBOX showcase was the best PC gaming show this year.
2020-07-26 02:05:52: PS5 win in Asia for sure, console wars only happened on US only. Here in Indonesia almost nobody talk about xbox series x, MS lose the war even the war has not begun here.
2020-07-26 02:31:58: Maan... im disappointed, You can see its kinda rushed by looking at the bad guy's texture, it looks like halo 2.
2020-07-26 03:48:58: I really wanted the series x but theyre pushing me towards pS5
2020-07-26 07:05:50: > Ps5 yanked you in while the Xbox series X pushed you even further....that's a big yikes for Xbox
2020-07-26 11:37:56: > Myntrix someone cant read
2020-07-26 11:44:49: > @Yo Shane TUBE TV there rephrased so you can understand
2020-07-26 16:14:24: > Myntrix oh lmao my bad
2020-10-24 22:06:24: > Betting you have started to lean back to Xbox ;)
2020-07-26 03:53:51: They need to show more gameplay demos.
2020-07-26 04:10:48: Mehh
2020-07-26 05:19:00: Tell Me Why? This game was made lol!
2020-07-26 06:34:24: 17:50 Reminds me of Zelda
2020-07-26 06:45:02: L
2020-07-26 09:34:49: Tetris...Okay Microsoft, take my Money!
2020-07-26 10:46:12: Compare this to the PS5 showcase. Guess who's winning this generation?
2020-07-26 11:16:37: I wanted gameplay, not just an overhyped trailer
2020-07-29 01:31:32: > After watching Halo's gameplay, I think i preffer overhyped trailers XD
2020-07-29 03:38:36: > Did you even watch 5 minutes of the video?
2020-07-26 11:47:34: DOA
2020-07-26 12:29:52: Suggestion for the Halo Infinite sound design team: the game clicks where it should clunk.
2020-07-26 12:37:54: > +Grass should not dissappear  4:58
2020-07-26 12:52:22: Am I missing something here I though the presentation was great and far better than the ps5 one.  Xbox first part lineup so far Halo, Forza Motorsport, state of decay 3, avowed, fable, grounded, everwild, hellblade 2, flight simulator, psyconauts 2, the medium. Vs Ps5 first party lineup so far Spiderman upgrade/DLC, horizon forbidden west, ratchet and Clank, sack boy, demon's souls remake, gt7.  Not only that but all the Xbox games are on gamepass
2020-07-29 14:24:04: > Lol you can play all of the xbox series x games on pc  so what's the point of buying an xbox?
2020-07-26 14:02:11: Lol Halo looks like Cod Blackout. PS5 for the win.
2020-07-26 17:20:11: Too many rpg!!!!
2020-07-26 19:29:03: Obsidian Master Race !!
2020-07-26 19:39:08: I Love XBOX
2020-07-26 19:58:57: Why do game companies not realize that without GAMEPLAY the trailers are meaningless?
2020-07-29 07:38:52: > These are teasers I think and they said they had more coming so they might show gameplay in the next showcase.
2020-07-29 12:42:33: > Idk depends on the games if I would see one pixel of Gta 6 I would be hyped
2020-07-26 20:30:19: This trailer has me hyped hahahah. I cant wait to play. Gotta go check Gamepass now!
2020-07-26 21:57:18: 7:00 god look at them mountains, in Minecraft taking out the cloud rendering helps ,just an fyi
2020-07-31 05:57:59: > That are buildings not mountains ‍️‍️‍️
2020-07-26 23:40:50: HALO very bad graphics
2020-07-27 01:03:06: Ok ps1 graphics 
2020-07-28 22:43:01: > Ehhh they looked early _PS2_ at best
2020-08-19 01:33:59: > Looked ps3 and 360
2020-07-27 01:20:03: Halo looked amazing! I'm SO hyped for this game. It has the soul of the old Halo CE
2020-07-27 01:24:06: Xbox / Microsoft -- Thank you for saving the BEST FOR LAST.  I'd buy the Console just for that last game.  I've waited & waited & waited -- that was one of my beloved games ... next to ...       BRUTE FORCE ... (and) Hunter:  The Reckoning ... (and) Voodoo Vince -- but you already resurrected #3 -- just hope you can bring those other two back to life too !!!
2020-07-27 01:29:26: Mas que bosta de gráficos! Decepção!
2020-08-02 07:50:24: > Entao chora
2020-07-27 02:18:06: Fable !!!!!!!!
2020-07-27 04:11:11: I wish was also in HDR it would look 100 times better.
2020-07-27 04:49:52: So now both consoles are going to have destiny 2 again and gta v again. Wow.
2020-07-27 05:33:45: That's allot of 4k 60hz, but not enough 4k 120hz.
2020-07-27 06:03:34: I really hope everwild isn't a side scroller
2020-07-27 06:03:52: If microsoft studios cannot deliver Halo how can i expect them to give good console. Um until now i was xbox fan but i think this time it's worth buying ps5 insted of fake 12TF xbox. It's gimmick. DON'T BUY NEXT XBOX.
2020-07-27 13:31:43: Put bus simulator 18 in the game pass
2020-07-27 15:51:38: Everwild est très attirant, je suis curieux
2020-07-27 16:42:30: Fable's here  Thanks so much XBX 
2020-07-27 23:31:16: > We're eager to see it return!

2020-07-27 20:07:53: Halo tf
2020-07-27 21:40:22: Does anybody know the name of the song for the trailer at tbe end of the showcase?
2020-07-27 21:50:43: I'm just only excited for State of Decay, Fable and Halo
2020-07-27 22:22:57: > That's a lot to be excited for!
2020-07-27 22:37:46: I thought the Halo game looked AMAZING. I personally love what yall did with the looks of everything and for the more focus on the campaign. It really looks like yall went back to the roots of Halo. Im SO EXCITED!!!!!
2020-07-27 22:50:36: > Awesome to hear that! We're really excited too.
2020-07-28 00:55:47: Haha lmao hahaha this PC showcase was awesome
2020-07-28 01:27:57: Imagine fighting the flood in an open world inhabited by wildlife  hype
2020-08-19 01:30:40: > Dude imagine Jackel snipers
2020-10-24 22:03:12: > @Dark Gamer now you will have to legit snipe then because they will be on the mountain tops
2020-07-28 02:18:48: This looks great
2020-07-28 03:51:32: Its sad seeing these halo graphics, but at least theres a pug voice actor in the credits.
2020-07-28 04:39:08: Some of these actually look interesting just want to know how they play out.
2020-09-05 12:14:54: > These games are going to deliver .

2020-07-28 18:31:10: Xbox could make the most powerful console in the world all they want. but without any amazing exclusive games, its just glorified dust collector like my Xbox One.....
